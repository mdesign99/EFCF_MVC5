However, few studies show how the player’s position on the leaderboard can be a demotivating factor and how the presence of a leaderboard can increase competition and social pressure on players to the point of hindering their game experience. In examining the relationship between a leaderboard and the player’s game experience, we sought to identify the significant factors influencing whether or not a player liked the presence of a leaderboard in a digital maths game. We conducted an experimental study involving 434 Irish primary school children who participated in a 6-week digital game-based learning (DGBL) programme playing the game Seven Spells, which included a game leaderboard. Results indicated that the players’ enjoyment of the leaderboard depended not only on their in-game performance (i.e. their position on the leaderboard), but also on their level of maths anxiety and how much they enjoyed different play modes such as playing versus a classmate or playing alone. These results suggest that game designers should consider the non-cognitive traits of players when deciding on the inclusion of a leaderboard in a digital maths game, in order to mitigate its potential negative effects on the players’ game experience. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","game design; game-based learning; maths anxiety","Game design; Digital game-based learning; Game design; Game experience; Game-based Learning; Learning outcome; Learning projects; Math anxiety; Player's enjoyments; Primary school children; Social pressures; Serious games","","","","","","","The Happy Maths Programme.

Game Theory-based paradigms utilizing socio-economic and trust-based contexts have been established to elicit specific emotional responses in autistic individuals. Serious games, incorporating cohesive storylines and multiple interactions within these contexts, can serve as engaging tools for emotion elicitation in autistic individuals. As autistic adolescents tend to show higher engagement with games, we aimed to investigate applicability in this population. To achieve this, we developed a mobile serious game that combines four socio-economic and trust-based game paradigms, aiming to evoke specific emotions of varying intensities during different interactions. This paper presents the outcomes of a preliminary experiment involving thirteen participants. The results show that the game’s designed interactions successfully elicited emotional responses aligning with the expectations derived from literature in non-game applications. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Affective Computing; Autism; Decision-making; Depression; Emotion Elicitation; Game Theory; Serious Games","Computation theory; Decision theory; Game theory; Serious games; Affective Computing; Autism; Decisions makings; Depression; Emotion elicitation; Emotional response; Empirical research; Socio-economics; Storylines; Theoretical research; Decision making","","","","","","","23+ Mobile Gaming Statistics for 2022; Ahmed F., Et al., Socio-economic decision making and emotion elicitation with a serious game in the wild, Appl.

Those students are enrolled in the DLE of DMT project, which hosts several activities [12]. The technological component of the DLE includes a Moodle platform integrated with an Advanced Computing Environment, a tool designed for learning STEM disciplines [13].

The project aims at investigating how Serious Games (SG) can enhance the health conditions of young people with chronic diseases, specifically targeting two categories: individuals with Down Syndrome and those with Asthma. The SG employs a narrative strategy within an immersive, interactive setup. The child’s movements are captured and translated into actions performed by an in-game avatar, who is central to the story. Additionally, a wristband continuously monitors the child’s physiological data, ensuring they remain within the aerobic zone.

Designing a learning game might be even harder as it requires engaging game elements to be aligned with the respective learning content. However, when this alignment is successful—referred to as intrinsic integration—games become effective tools for learning. In this article, the idea of collectible content is introduced as one way to achieve or make more pervasive use of intrinsic integration to support learning. Similar to an in-game currency system, learning content may be incorporated as in-game collectibles whose collection and manipulation are central aspects of gameplay. To substantiate the beneficial effects of collectible content, it is repeatedly presented, explored, and analyzed through various gameplay tasks. Through its characteristics of duality, consistency, and uniqueness/uniformity, collectible content evolves and adapts offering continuous opportunities for the development of conceptual understanding of the respective content—along with practice of procedures and acquisition of fact knowledge for the tasks at hand. To illustrate the idea and highlight affordances and potential impact of intrinsic integration, we present a prototype design of a fraction learning game to showcase a modular ecosystem focused on collectible content gameplay. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Equivalent; Fractions; Game-based learning; Intrinsic Integration; Mathematics; Number line","Ecosystems; Learning systems; Equivalent; Fraction; Game elements; Game-based Learning; Gameplay; Intrinsic integration; Learning contents; Learning game; Modulars; Number line; Integration","","","","","","","Byun J., Joung E., Digital game-based learning for K–12 mathematics education: A meta-analysis, Sch.

Depending on the severity of the injury and the affected regions of the brain, consequences vary a lot. Apart from physical challenges, a person with TBI may have various cognitive deficits, which affect the cognitive load of the person in different situations. The paper presents an early paper prototype for a wearable cognitive load measurement device design using biomarkers from an electroencephalogram (EEG). The paper discusses how the rehabilitation and daily tasks could be adjusted and optimized for individuals’ needs by using such a cognitive load measurement tool. Designing this kind of system requires skills from various disciplines. Thus, the early product design was created in a multidisciplinary workshop. As everyday EEG-based tools are still in their early development phase, it is very important to pay a lot of attention to technical development. However, in order to facilitate the implementation of such technology, it is also crucial to concentrate on easy-to-wear, user-friendly, and fashionable product design. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","cognitive load; EEG; product design; traumatic brain injury","Brain; Product design; Wearable technology; Brain injury; Cognitive deficits; Cognitive load measurement; Cognitive loads; Daily tasks; Device design; Measurement device; Measurement tools; Paper prototypes; Traumatic Brain Injuries; Electroencephalography","","","","","","","Mollayeva T., A systematic review of fatigue in patients with traumatic brain injury: The course, predictors and consequences, Neurosci.

A group of institutionalized older adults experiencing persistent pain, without cognitive impairment, was recruited. Sociodemographic data were collected, and pain intensity was measured using the Visual Analogue Pain Scale (VAS) before and after a 20-min game-based intervention. Post-intervention, participants were interviewed about their personal experiences with the game. The “Tree Game,” a giant floorboard game (Agilidades.pt), was selected for its unique properties conducive to this study (e.g., multi-stimuli approach). Significant differences in VAS scores before and after the Tree Game intervention were analyzed using the Wilcoxon test. Qualitative analysis of participants’ feedback was also conducted. Results indicated that seventeen participants reported a reduction in pain following the game-based intervention (Group 1). The VAS scores demonstrated significant improvement in pain perception post-intervention (median = 4.50 vs. 3.00; P = 0.005). Six themes emerged from the qualitative analysis, describing the “Tree Game” as a playful and engaging experience that positively influenced pain perception. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.","chronic pain; Non-pharmacological therapy; older adults","Chronic pain; Game-Based; Mixed method; Non-pharmacological therapy; Older adults; Pain perception; Pilot studies; Post interventions; Qualitative analysis; Tree games","","","","","Agència de Gestió d’Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca de la Generalitat de Catalunya, (2023 FI-3 00107); Foundation for Science and Technology of Portugal, (02549)","This work has been made possible through the financial support of two key scholarships - FI scholarship program of the Ag\u00E8ncia de Gesti\u00F3 d\u2019Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca de la Generalitat de Catalunya provided under the code \u201C2023 FI-3 00107\u201D; doctoral research scholarship program of the Foundation for Science and Technology of Portugal, with funding granted under the reference \u201C2023. 02549.BDANA.\u201D Thank you Emanuel Silva and Ana Carolina, for their participation in the transcription of the interviews.","Frondini C., Lanfranchi G., Minardi M., Cucinotta D., Affective, behavior and cognitive disorders in the elderly with chronic musculoskeletal pain: The impact on an aging population, Arch.

Although GBLEs have been developed to improve science learning, learners have attained lower science achievement scores over the past decade as they progress through school. As such, there is a need to better understand how learners use game mechanics as they learn about science content. This study aimed to understand how learners generally use and transition between learning and assessment mechanics while learning about science with a GBLE and how those transitions were related to learning outcomes (i.e., learning gains, game success). High-school students (N = 137) were recruited to play Crystal Island, a GBLE about microbiology. Results found that participants used static learning mechanics (e.g., virtual books about microbiology) most often, followed by game and content assessment mechanics, and lastly followed by aid and dynamic learning mechanics. Further results found that several sequential transition probabilities were related to lower learning outcomes with a few transitions positively relating to game completion success. Findings from this study also show that the type of game mechanic, as well as the direction of transitions across game mechanics significantly relate to learning outcomes. These findings provide insights into how to develop scaffolding techniques for improving science learning outcomes. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Game-based Learning; Gaming Mechanics; Science Learning; Transition Matrices","Microorganisms; Domain knowledge; Game-based Learning; Game-based learning environments; Gaming mechanic; High school students; Learn+; Learning gain; Learning outcome; Science learning; Transition matrices; Computer aided instruction","","","","","","","(2022); Lester J.C., Spires H.A., Nietfeld J.L., Minogue J., Mott B.W., Lobene E.V., Designing game-based learning environments for elementary science education: A narrative-centered learning perspective, Inf.

Thereby, we attempt to position the design activity itself as playful and explore how the idea of how playing and engaging in experiments with prototypes could be seen as making.

While mathematics teachers see “maths games” as useful tools, their lack of knowledge about teaching with such games as well as shortage of appropriate games for teaching upper secondary school mathematics prevents the full potential of game-based teaching. This study presents GeomWiz, a gamified geometry quiz, for learning geometry in upper secondary schools as well as two teaching scenarios for using it in teaching. A student user experience study was carried out in three European countries in which teachers piloted GeomWiz and the teaching scenarios. Based on the results, game-based learning with game contents that matches the learning objectives is suitable for geometry teaching in upper secondary schools. Teaching scenarios assist the inclusion of the game into teaching. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Game-based Learning; Implementation; Maths Game; Teaching Scenario; User Experience","Students; Digital games; Game-Based; Game-based Learning; Implementation; Math game; Mathematics teachings; Secondary mathematics; Secondary schools; Teaching scenario; Users' experiences; Geometry","","","","","","","Kacmaz G., Dube A.K., Examining pedagogical approaches and types of mathematics knowledge in educational games: A meta-analysis and critical review, Educ.

This paper proposes a work-in-progress role-play simulation serious game design with the theme of international trade designed for grades 5–8 to enact roles of producers, importers, and exporters as well as develop economic decision-making strategies. The paper begins by discussing the necessity of serious games in K-12 economic education. Next, the paper elucidates the design process employed in creating the serious game “eKinomy” and embedding the simulation and role-play elements into it. We outline the steps taken to ensure that the game aligns with the learning objectives of economic education while providing an engaging and immersive experience for learners. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Economic Education; Game Design; K-12 Education; Role-Play Games (RPG); Serious Game; Simulation","Decision making; Design; Game design; International trade; Economic decision-making; Economic education; Elementary levels; Game design; Immersive; K-12 education; Learning experiences; Role-play game; Role-plays; Simulation; Serious games","","","","","","","Susi T., Johannesson M., Backlund P., Serious Games: An Overview.

Teachers are often unaware of aggressive acts among their students, and even when they are, many consider that they are not responsible for resolving cyberbullying issues. Therefore, it is fundamental to develop resources based on human-machine collaboration to attain several milestones in designing serious games to prevent and intervene in cyberbullying by providing teachers with know-how through interactive training with artificial intelligence. The game presented, along with its face validity (n = 290 units for content analysis), offer technology professionals the necessary knowledge to develop future interventions to counter cyberbullying. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Cyberbullying; Serious games; Social agents; Teachers","Computer crime; Personnel training; Social behavior; Technology transfer; Blended learning; Cyber bullying; Emotion regulations; Game prototypes; Resources based; Social agents; Social behaviour; Teachers training programs; Teachers'; Well being; Serious games","","","","","Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT, (PTDC/PSI-GER/1918/2020, UIDP/04527/2020)","Acknowledgements.

By examining the various layers of the iceberg metaphorically, one can gain a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness and interdependencies within systems, enabling to make more informed and connected decisions and foster sustainable change in a complex world. By applying the Iceberg Model in the context of serious games, Systemic Design Oriented Leadership (SDOL) in particular could gain a holistic understanding of the hidden dynamics that determine behaviour and outcomes within their organizations. A serious game of this nature has the capacity to augment a leadership learning culture that fosters the investigation of cognitive frameworks, the interrogation of presumptions, and the cultivation of critical thinking. Through dialogue and reflection, SDOL could surface underlying beliefs and values. SDOLthat embraces the gamification of the Iceberg Model might effectively drive sustainable change in a playful manner. By focusing the gameplay on levels such as “mental models” and “systemic structures”, SDOL can design interventions that address the root causes of challenges rather than applying quick fixes. The Iceberg Model as a serious game fosters a culture of continuous improvement and adaptability, positioning the organization for long-term success. This paper explores the application of the Iceberg Model as a physical serious game in SDOL, highlighting its significance in identifying and addressing underlying factors that impact organizational behavior and performance. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","iceberg model; leadership; serious games; systems thinking","Decision making; Sea ice; Serious games; Cognitive frameworks; Critical thinking; Decisions makings; Gamification; Haptics; Iceberg modelling; Leadership; Learning cultures; System thinkings; Systemic designs; Systems thinking","","","","","","","Nilsson J., Jansson J., Vall G.H., Modig F., The importance of market and entrepreneurial strategic orientations among companies committed to sustainability values and practices, Bus.

The board game was created around imagining plausible futures and aimed at providing scenarios for players to make decisions about their futures considering social, economic and health inequalities. The paper showcases an exploratory approach of identifying game design elements based on co-design sessions with stakeholders (young people between the ages of 14–17) and experts, while using real-world scenarios and game design balancing techniques. The contributions of the paper are twofold: 1) it describes the process of making the board game via stakeholder participation, game design systems and game balancing; and 2) it provides a research-through-design method in which the design of the game reflects the intrinsic system in which young people live and suggests ways to overcome barriers established by these systems. The paper concludes with suggestions for future research such as the use of the game in participatory design sessions, mentoring classes and as an initial framework for serious games that can emerge from the discussions (e.g., teaching life skills, entrepreneurship competencies, etc.). © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Board Game Design; Coastal communities; Game Balancing; Gamification; Places and Inequalities; Plausible Futures; Young People","Design; Serious games; Board game design; Board games; Coastal communities; Design-process; Game balancing; Game design; Gamification; Place and inequality; Plausible future; Young peoples; Game design","","","","","","","Whitty C., Chief Medical Officer’s Annual Report 2021: Health in Coastal Communities, (2021); The English Indices of Deprivation 2019.

Three Games With A Purpose (GWAPs) were created to revise and correct automatically tagged Parts-of-Speech (PoS) of the Corpus Oral y Sonoro del Español Rural (COSER, [5], ‘Audible Corpus of Spoken Rural Spanish’), the most extensive collection of spoken dialectal Spanish data. The ultimate goal of the project is to build a morpho-syntactically annotated and parsed corpus of the European Spanish dialects through a crowd-sourced gaming environment, whereby players assign a PoS, i.e., a grammatical category (e.g., verb, noun, adjective, pronoun), to a word in an input text thereby confirming or correcting the automatically tagged PoS. This task has been implemented in three GWAPs: Agentes, Tesoros, and Anotatlón. Each game concept includes a set of GDEs (e.g., rewards, challenges, leaderboards, among others) to investigate their influence on PE. This study, which includes 54 participants, shows associations between PTs and GDEs, and some GDEs yielded a positive correlation with PE. These findings hold the potential to inspire future research and guide the design of future serious games. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Game Design Elements; Games With A Purpose; Part-of-Speech Tagging; Personality Traits; Player Enjoyment; Serious Games","Computational linguistics; Design; Game design; Natural language processing systems; Design elements; Empirical studies; Game design; Game design element; Game with A purpose; Part Of Speech; Part of speech tagging; Parts-of-speech tagging; Personality traits; Player's enjoyments; Serious games","","","","","Flemish Research Fund; Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, FWO, (I000418N); Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, FWO","Acknowledgements.

Instead, this fully online course aims to deepen students’ understanding of the complex effects of globalization on politics, cultures, the environment, and interpersonal interactions across diverse global communities. Utilizing the 2D, web-based, role-play serious game Graveler - Globe Traveler - as both a learning and communication platform, the course employs a “virtual trip around the world” didactic concept. Presented here are the findings from four classes conducted since 2023 using this innovative educational approach. We detail the capabilities of Graveler that enhance student learning experiences and discuss the methodology and outcomes of our study, including a quantitative survey on the game’s acceptance and a qualitative analysis of students’ final assignments to assess learning outcomes.

More specifically, this research evaluates adaptive number knowledge (ANK), an ability to understand whole-number relations and apply this knowledge flexibly to solve new problems. Our study involved 130 primary school students playing the digital game “Seven Spells”, which focuses on arithmetic operations and numeric tables. Students’ ANK skills were assessed through a pen-and-paper timed task before and after playing the game for six weeks. Three gameplay performance metrics were collected: the highest level achieved in a multi-player mode, the highest score in single-player mode, and the leaderboard position in single-player mode. Linear regression analysis revealed that the progress against virtual opponents significantly predicted various improvements in ANK skills. Conversely, higher leaderboard positions in the single-player mode were unexpectedly correlated with some reduced ANK gains, likely due to a lack of engagement in this game mode. Student feedback indicated a preference for multiplayer mode, which may have fostered higher engagement and skill development. Our contribution suggests games can support adaptive expertise development and highlights the importance of identifying specific game design features for learning. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.","Adaptive Expertise; Adaptive Number Knowledge; Maths games","Game design; Regression analysis; Adaptive expertise; Adaptive number knowledge; Arithmetic operations; Digital games; Gameplay; Math game; Performance; Primary schools; School students; Whole numbers; Students","","","","","","","Hui H.B., Sofwan Mahmud M., Influence of game-based learning in mathematics education on the students’ cognitive and affective domain: A systematic review, Front.

However, concerns remain about students becoming overly immersed, which could lead them to stray from the learning goals of GBL. This study utilises Cross-recurrence quantification analysis (CRQA) to investigate the dynamic relationship between cognitive and emotional engagement in GBL settings. Fifty participants watched two Minecraft gameplay videos and engaged in cognitive tasks that involved identifying creative gameplay behaviours. The timesync comments technology was used to record students’ timed responses. After categorising these comments into cognitive or emotional engagements using Content Analysis, CRQA was used to explore these engagements. Findings revealed a high synchronicity in cognitive and emotional engagement across both videos. The second video, notable for its exaggerated narration and imaginative gameplay, triggered more frequent recurring emotional and cognitive states, indicating a pattern of more consistent engagement. The study discusses how to balance cognitive and emotional stimulation when designing serious games. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.","cognition; CRQA; emotion; video games","Adversarial machine learning; Game design; Interactive computer graphics; Cognition; Cross recurrences; Cross-recurrence quantification analyze; Dynamics analysis; Emotion; Emotional engagements; Game-based Learning; Gameplay; Recurrence quantification analysis; Video-games; Students","","","","","","","G2A: Educators Turn to Gaming to Enable Pandemic Learning; Kiili K., Ketamo H., Evaluating cognitive and affective outcomes of a digital game-based math test, IEEE Trans.

Phillips’ taxonomy categorizes game rewards into six types based on their functions within game systems. Given the rapid evolution of video games, this research investigates whether this taxonomy remains applicable to current gaming landscapes. The study consisted of two main steps: firstly, a detailed analysis of rewards in seven video games from various genres was performed and secondly, a card sorting activity with expert players was conducted. Results shown that while Phillips’ taxonomy resulted to be still applicable, the need for two additional categories, rewards of currency and rewards of self-expression, emerged, reflecting the evolving dynamics in game design and player preferences. Future research will explore the relationship between these reward categories and the fulfilment of basic psychological needs as outlined by Self-Determination Theory, to enhance the motivational impact of gamification. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.","Game design; gamification; motivation; reward taxonomy; Self-Determination Theory; video games","Gamification; Taxonomies; 'current; Card-sorting; Game design; Game players; Game system; Gamification; Phillips; Reward taxonomy; Self-determination theories; Video-games; Game design","","","","","","","Huang W.D., Loid V., Sung J.S., Reflecting on gamified learning in medical education: A systematic literature review grounded in the structure of observed learning outcomes (SOLO) taxonomy 2012–2022, BMC Med.

In this paper, we demonstrate the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques in the esports domain, particularly in simulation (sim) racing, for analyzing drivers’ behaviour based on telemetry data from race drivers. To achieve this, we used a professional racing simulator to collect a wide range of feature-rich telemetry data from 93 participants through MoTec telemetry software and the ACC sim racing gaming platform. An objective assessment of the characteristics of the driver’s behaviour was then obtained through a set of predefined lap-based metrics derived from telemetry data. Additionally, a comparison of driving styles was carried out using machine learning approaches for grouping the acquired laps based on performance (lap time). The findings from our analysis contribute to a better understanding of how elite drivers differ from low skilled drivers based on their telemetry. Furthermore, our findings provide researchers with key metrics to develop more efficient training tools and techniques to improve sim racing performance. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Artificial Intelligence; Machine Learning; MoTec; Sim racing","Behavioral research; Computer software; Simulation platform; Telemetering equipment; Artificial intelligence learning; Computer gaming; Driving behaviour; E-sports; High quality; Machine-learning; Motec; Performance; Sim racing; Telemetry data; Machine learning","","","","","","","Lindsey G.R., Tatistical data useful for the operation of a baseball team, Oper.

Our findings include interaction styles that can be applied in HRI as well as the directionality and (multi)modality of these interaction styles. We identified several areas of risk, including miscommunication, privacy concerns, and injuries. Lastly, we explored common human learning outcomes based on the interaction categories. Our findings fill a gap in the literature by providing an analysis of immersive learning outcomes and risks in the field of HRI.

Our game studio aims to incorporate scientifically accurate evolutionary models into gameplay mechanics. In our previous games Darwin’s Demons and Project Hastur, we designed digital genomes and implemented evolutionary models to create enemy populations that adapt to player strategies. However, accurately simulating evolution can sometimes conflict with crafting an enjoyable game. Here we examine balancing scientific realism with fun in the game design process. Using experimental data from Project Hastur, we show enemies evolve increased size and sensory abilities to counter player defenses, demonstrating the game mechanic’s adaptive capabilities. We discuss how mutation rates, population sizes, generation times and other parameters can be adjusted to balance accuracy and enjoyment, with the goal of creating engaging games that reinforce and demonstrate, rather than misrepresent, evolutionary principles. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Adaptation; Evolution; Gamification; STEM; Video Games","Computer games; Design; Human computer interaction; Interactive computer graphics; Population statistics; Adaptation; Biological evolution; Design and implementations; Evolution; Evolutionary biology; Evolutionary models; Gameplay; Gamification; STEM; Video-games; Game design","","","","","","","Miller J.D., Et al., Public acceptance of evolution in the United States, 1985–2020, Public Underst.

Then, we investigated if children habitually playing video games at home have an advantage when it comes to learning using educational games. In order to answer these questions, we exploited the data coming from the digital game-based learning (DGBL) intervention Happy Maths, a 6-week programme run in Irish primary schools aimed to increase maths abilities and decrease maths anxiety (MA). The dataset contained the academic achievements, the video game habits and the intervention data of 952 pupils. Our results show how playing games at home that are not age-appropriate was associated with higher MA and lower maths score, while time spent playing was associated with higher MA and lower literacy score. Regarding the efficacy of the DGBL intervention, there was no difference in the efficacy of the intervention between gamers and non-gamers. However, habitual video gamers were faster in executing their game moves, and they achieved higher scores, learning the game better. Overall, the study underlines the importance of playing age-appropriate games, and it provides evidence that, although kids playing video game might have a good advantage when it comes to educational games, the efficacy of such games is the same for gamers and non-gamers. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","academic achievements; digital game-based learning","Computer games; Human computer interaction; Interactive computer graphics; Academic achievements; Anxiety levels; Digital game-based learning; Educational game; Low literacies; Primary school children; Primary schools; Time-spent; Video-games; E-learning","","","","","","","The Happy Maths Programme, (2013); Alsaad F., Et al., Impact of action video gaming behavior on attention, anxiety, and sleep among university students, Psychol.

The game employs a series of open-ended missions based on real-life environmental issues, framing the missions as wicked problems, i.e., complex problems that resist straightforward solutions due to their evolving and often contradictory requirements. This approach was chosen since real-life environmental issues fall under the domain of wicked problems, yet traditional education largely focuses on unambiguous problems with clear-cut solutions.

State-of-the-art algorithms often overlook the concurrent emotions and motivation of individuals and its impact on GBL interventions. This pilot study utilized a 3 (feedback type: results, elaborative, attribution) x 2 (graph type: misleading, non-misleading) within-subjects design with MediaWatch, a GBL environment built to improve critical graph literacy. At an Austrian university, 41 students’ concurrent emotions and motivation were measured using validated surveys immediately after different types of feedback on tasks during GBL. Results showed a significant improvement in graph literacy after GBL. Different types of feedback and task performance influenced concurrent emotions and interest, but individual differences accounted for the largest variability explained in emotions and interest. The findings suggest that within-subject variability is crucial for understanding concurrent emotions and motivation to feedback types and task performance during GBL. © The Author(s) 2025.","Emotions; Feedback; Game-based Learning; Motivation","Adversarial machine learning; Federated learning; Adaptive games; Emotion; Feedback type; Game-based Learning; Game-based learning environments; Immediate feedbacks; Learning effectiveness; Pilot studies; State-of-the-art algorithms; Task performance; Contrastive Learning","","","","","European Commission, EC, (101105874)","This study was funded by the European Union ([EU] ID No. 101105874).

Even if game elements do not directly affect cognitive learning outcomes, they can keep learners engaged and support long-term loyalties. In this contribution, we present an investigation of the effect of game elements with a specific focus on affective and motivational aspects. In particular, we report a value-added online experiment, comparing a game-based version with a non-game-based version of an association learning task. In total, 61 participants completed the experiment. While we find comparable cognitive learning outcomes, we find medium and large differences in affective and motivational outcomes. Game elements are associated with an increase in positive affect and increased perceived competence compared to the non-game-based task. The game-based task was further perceived significantly more attractive and stimulating. Mediation models revealed that the increased cognitive cost introduced by game elements was effectively balanced by their benefits regarding motivation. The latter was partially mediated by changes in positive affect. In sum, the net cognitive outcome was the same for both tasks, but learners in the game-based condition were more positively affected, more motivated and felt more competent. Implications and future research directions are discussed. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","affect; association learning; cognition; game elements; motivation","Affect; Association learning; Cognition; Cognitive learning; Game elements; Game-Based; Learner's motivations; Learning outcome; Learning tasks; Positive affects; Motivation","","","","","","","Ryan R.M., Rigby C.S., Motivational foundations of game-based learning, Handbook of Game-Based Learning, pp. 153-176, (2020); Barz N., Benick M., Dorrenbacher-Ulrich L., Perels F., The effect of digital game-based learning interventions on cognitive, metacognitive, and affective-motivational learning outcomes in school: A meta-analysis, Rev.

Numerous awareness initiatives have been implemented to meet this, including advertising campaigns and educational materials. Serious games combine entertainment with education and offer a powerful communication strategy to engage society and promote sustainability awareness. This paper presents Pick Energy Cards, a prototype of a serious game designed to educate players on energy consumption, water waste, and environmental pollution. The study’s primary focus is the evaluation process, which aims to validate the game concept and assess both its usability and playability before testing its educational impact. To achieve this, the EGameFlow usability survey has been employed. A diverse group of 24 participants, aged 18 to 60, with varying levels of video game experience, participated in the study. After playing the game, participants completed the survey. The results demonstrate that Pick Energy Cards has the potential to serve as an effective learning tool for players across all age groups. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.","Energy; Evaluation; Gamification; Household ecology; Serious games; Sustainability","Clean energy; Game design; Gamification; Sustainable development; Advertizing campaigns; Communication strategy; Design and evaluations; Educational materials; Energy; Energy-consumption; Evaluation; Gamification; Household ecology; Sustainability education","","","","","","","Ecologia domèstica; Abdusselam M., The effect of serious games on the awareness of energy sources consumption, Int.

Based on previous research on these topics, we present the results of training teachers to design educational activities using gamification and GenAI. This paper analyses the 32 activities designed by 47 lower secondary school teachers from all disciplines during the training course. The research questions of this study concern teachers’ ability to make significant use of both gamification and GenAI in the design of the activity and their added value in education. The activities designed by teachers and their responses to the initial and final questionnaires were analyzed. The results show a paradigm shift in the implementation of gamification with the use of GenAI tools, a large variety of strategies such as involvement, rewards, progression, and challenge, and the need for further training to offer students innovative teaching methods. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.","Design of Game Mechanics; Gamified Educational Activities; Generative Artificial Intelligence for Gamification; Teacher Training","Active learning; Adversarial machine learning; Contrastive Learning; Federated learning; Game design; Gamification; Personnel training; Students; Teaching; Artificial intelligence tools; Design of game mechanic; Educational activities; Gamification; Gamified educational activity; Generative artificial intelligence for gamification; Learning Activity; Paper analysis; Teacher training; Teachers'","","","","","Istituto Nazionale di Alta; Fondazione De Agostini; Fondazione Comunità Novarese Onlus","The research was carried out within the Indam\u2014Istituto Nazionale di Alta.

Hence, the aim is to analyze the conceptual patterns between gamification and artificial intelligence in education, by reviewing 41 scientific articles from the databases Web of Science and Scopus that combine both terminologies to examine the level of education, role in the educational process, artificial intelligence technology used, elements of games and contributions to education. The results show their connection is mostly observed in higher education and in secondary education for the learning process of students, while the use of artificial intelligence is mostly used in the processing of computerized vision, natural language and use of algorithms through assisted digital platforms. In turn, the main elements incorporated in these experiences are points, levels and competence, giving added value in the teaching process. Finally, the significant contributions are directed towards the teaching of new skills and to the optimization of performance. While there are positive effects on the use of artificial intelligence and gamification as adaptive tools that allow optimizing feedback and help students achieve their objectives, there is still a need to explore this connection at other educational levels, in other roles and with other artificial intelligence and playful technologies, making it possible to expand the implementation in this context. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.","Artificial intelligence; education; gamification; learning; natural language","Contrastive Learning; Federated learning; Students; Artificial intelligence in education; Context analysis; Educational context; Gamification; Learning; Natural languages; Scientific articles; Scientific literature; Skills development; Web of Science; Gamification","","","","","","","Deterding S., Dixon D., Khaled R., Nacke L., From game design elements to gamefulness: Defining “gamification”, Proceedings of the 16Th International Academic Mindtrek Conference, pp. 9-15, (2011); Hamari J., Koivisto J., Sarsa H., Does gamification work?

Fully immersive virtual reality (VR) must consider and address the needs of diverse user groups. In this paper, we propose to assess user performance, task completion and input modality preferences for a range of different gameplay modes, in either a standing or sitting position, in the educational game “Numbers and Letters”. We assess the performance and usability of three input modalities: 1) a hand laser pointer for pointing and a trigger for selection, 2) a head laser pointer for pointing and a trigger for selection, and 3) a head laser pointer and a dwell time for selection, then assess differences in user performance between the sitting and standing positions for these three input modalities. The analysis was carried out with 14 users. The most preferred input modality was the hand laser pointer in the sitting position. The results stress the need to develop multimodal VR games where users can determine the way they interact with the environment. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Educational Game; Input Modality; Multimodal interface; Virtual Reality","E-learning; Human computer interaction; Laser applications; Virtual addresses; Educational game; Educational video games; Immersive virtual reality; Input modalities; Laser pointer; Multi-modal interfaces; Performance tasks; Sitting positions; User groups; User performance; Virtual reality","","","","","","","Aguado-Delgado J., Gutierrez-Martinez J.M., Hilera J.R., de Marcos L., Oton S., Accessibility in video games: A systematic review, Univ.

But what about letting students design escape games instead of just playing them? By following a design-oriented learning approach, this paper explores the educational potential of students creating their own escape games as part of their coursework. We introduce the Escape This! Canvas, a visual inquiry tool that supports the process of designing educational escape games from creating a first idea and theme, over specifying a game structure, to reflecting and measuring the actual learning objectives. Our canvas aids in exploring, structuring, and communicating key design elements important for building new digital escape rooms. This paper contributes to understanding the components necessary for crafting educational escape games, offering a practical tool for iterative planning and project communication, and sheds light on the value of the design of escape rooms for educational purposes. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.","Design Canvas; Digital Escape Room; Serious Games","Adversarial machine learning; Contrastive Learning; Federated learning; Students; Courseworks; Design canvas; Design elements; Design-oriented learning; Digital escape room; Educational potential; Learning approach; Learning objectives; Project communications; Game design","","","","","Stiftung Innovation in der Hochschullehre","\u201CEscape This!\u201D is funded by Freiraum, Stiftung Innovation in der Hochschullehre (Innovation in Higher Education).

Our goal is to enhance student cooperation and simulate real-life scenarios through educational activities. We support teachers in designing asymmetric role-playing games using a specific model and tools. These games are relevant across various disciplines and educational levels, focusing on fostering cooperation. Our verification system helps ensure optimal cooperative opportunities in these scenarios. This article presents a method using Petri nets for modelling and verifying these role-playing scenarios, ensuring they promote collaboration. The method translates game tasks into reusable Petri net patterns, adaptable to various combinations. The system’s effectiveness has been tested in games with two to three players, providing valuable metrics for teachers on synchronisation risks but it needs adjustments for scenarios with repeated tasks and random resources. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.","automated check; co-design; Petri net; serious game","Game design; Model checking; Petri nets; Reusability; Teaching; Automated checks; Co-designs; Discipline levels; Educational activities; Educational levels; Learning scenarios; Modeling and verifications; Role playing; Role-playing game; Teachers'; Students","","","","","","","Alvarez J., Et al., A formal approach to distinguish games, toys, serious games and toys, serious repurposing and modding, and simulators, IEEE Trans.

As basis for virtual field trips, they have proven to be valuable learning tools. In technological terms, 360° spaces are to be characterized as single-user applications. In contrast, Social VR applications are characterized by multi-user capability and user-specific avatars. From a learning perspective, the concepts of collaborative learning and embodiment have long been proposed as conducive to learning. Both concepts might be supported using Social VR. However, there is hardly any knowledge about the use of 360° spaces and Social VR. Accordingly, the research question arises how Social VR-based 360° spaces are perceived by learners. This article presents a mixed-method evaluation study (N = 16) – using a questionnaire and focus group discussions – of a 360° space based on the Social VR platform Mozilla Hubs used on PCs. The study highlighted the opportunities offered by Social VR-based 360° spaces but also revealed several challenges that need to be addressed to embrace the potential of Social VR-based 360° spaces to be utilized regularly in education. Accordingly, the study represents relevant preparatory work for the use of multi-user 360° spaces in playful learning environments, such as educational escape rooms. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.","avatar; collaborative learning; desktop VR; embodiment; escape room game; playful digital environment; social presence","Federated learning; Avatar; Collaborative learning; Desktop VR; Digital environment; Embodiment; Escape room game; Learning tool; Playful digital environment; Social presence; Virtual field trips; Virtual environments","","","","","VR VET, (01132959 - ERASMUS-EDU-2023-PI-FORWARD-LOT2); European Commission, EC, (IN_WiSe23_02)","This work has been partly funded by VR VET (No. 01132959 - ERASMUS-EDU-2023-PI-FORWARD-LOT2) co-funded by the European Commission through the Erasmus+ program and the work also acknowledges the support by F\u00F6rderfond \u201CLehr-Innovationen\u201D (IN_WiSe23_02) by Bauhaus-Universit\u00E4t Weimar.

Enhancing such games with learning analytics (LA) can add value to the learning process. However, research on the design of LA for IVR games is limited. This paper launches gamified LA as game elements ‘by design’. It presents a process to design LA that (a) provide the most insightful information about learners’ behavior and performance to support self-monitoring and trigger reflection, and (b) inherit game properties from the IVR game to improve interactivity and promote learners’ engagement. We adopted basic principles of human-centric design and explored a space of game elements ideas to inspire desired outcomes. We involved 55 participants (pupils, teachers, domain experts, UX-designers, LA experts) in multiple rounds of workshops to co-design gamified LA that are educationally meaningful and relevant and at the same time intuitive and fit the playful nature of the IVR game. This paper explicates the design process and presents the results from the evaluation of the design outcomes. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.","gamified learning analytics; human-centered design; immersive virtual reality; practical skills; seamanship; vocational education","Adversarial machine learning; Apprentices; Behavioral research; Contrastive Learning; Design for manufacturability; Gamification; Teaching; Virtual environments; Formal education; Game elements; Gamified learning analytic; Human-centred designs; Immersive virtual reality; Learning process; Practical skill; Seamanship; Tacit knowledge; Vocational education; Game design","","","","","European Environment Agency, EEA; Norway Grants, (2022/348154); Norway Grants","This study was funded by the EEA and Norway Grants (Grant Number: 2022/348154).","Alvarez C.P., Martinez-Maldonado R., Buckingham Shum S., LA-DECK: A card-based learning analytics co-design tool, Proceedings of the 10Th International Conference on Learning Analytics & Knowledge, pp. 63-72, (2020); Arnab S., Et al., Mapping learning and game mechanics for serious games analysis, Br.

These barriers hinder teachers’ progress, diminish their motivation, and impede the transition toward game-based teaching. This article explores the valid barriers faced by teachers during video game integration into their classrooms and explores the application of the Solution-Focused Approach (SFA) instruments, namely SFA questions, as a possible means to address these barriers. The SFA questions facilitate a shift in focus from deficiencies to existing strengths and from an ineffective Problem Talk to an effective Solution Talk. Various SFA questions are provided to guide teachers toward fostering a healthier and more productive dialogue with themselves and others, allowing concentration on desired outcomes. Promising results of the SFA-based Education Professional Development Programme for Teachers are presented, and future directions are proposed to explore SFA application in this area. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Education Professional Development; Solution-Focused Approach (SFA); Video Games","Interactive computer graphics; Classroom instruction; Education professional development; Financial resources; Game-Based; Professional development; Solution-focused approach; Teachers'; Technical resources; Uncertainty; Video-games; Human computer interaction","","","","","","","Ruggiero D., Video games in the classroom: The teacher point of view, Games for Learning Workshop of the Foundations of Digital Games Conference, (2013); Can G., Cagiltay K., Turkish prospective teachers’ perceptions regarding the use of computer games with educational features, Educ.

This paper explores the application of large language models, such as ChatGPT, to help educators adapt educational serious games at runtime. To incorporate adaptation into serious games in a systematic way, we employ the MAPE-K loop framework. A key focus is the inclusion of educators in the adaptation process, who ensure that AI-driven changes align with educational goals. We thus propose an architecture that integrates player/learner data, game logic, and AI-generated adaptations, monitored and approved by educators via a dedicated browser-based dashboard, in a human-in-the-loop fashion. We show how we integrated this architecture into Untitled Bee Game, an existing educational serious game for eco-sustainability. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.","adaptation; education; mape-k loop; serious games; sustainability","Federated learning; Adaptation; Adaptation process; Eco-sustainability; Educational goals; Human-in-the-loop; Language model; Learning materials; Mape; Mape-k loop; Runtimes; Adversarial machine learning","","","","","NRRP; FAIR, (PE00000013)","We acknowledge the support of the PNRR project FAIR - Future AI Research (PE00000013), under the NRRP MUR program funded by the NextGenerationEU.","Tech. rep, IBM, (2005); Abt C., Serious Games, (1970); Bartle R., Hearts, Clubs, Diamonds, Spades: Players Who Suit Muds; Berger F., Muller W., Back to basics: Explainable AI for adaptive serious games, Fletcher, B., Ma, M., Göbel, S., Baalsrud Hauge, J., Marsh, T, pp. 67-81, (2021); Bloom B., Krathwohl D., Taxonomy of Educational Objectives: The Classification of Educational Goals.

Copper textile-based electrodes are integrated into a basic hat, and an HCI system is built around OpenBCI Ganglion device. As proof-of-concept applications, focus detection based on electroencephalography (EEG) and mobile game controlling based on electrooculogram (EOG) are presented. The functionality of these applications is tested by four participants. Based on the achieved results, this hat-integrated HCI system with copper-based textile electrodes can be an effective HCI medium for versatile serious games applications. Calibration of the system must be done for each participant, which will be the focus of our next study in this field. The results of this study are steps towards more user-friendly human-technology interfaces and game controllers, which can be integrated into our daily clothing for versatile serious games applications. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","EEG; electrode; EOG; focusing; games; OpenBCI; textiles; wearables","Copper; Electroencephalography; Electrophysiology; Human computer interaction; Serious games; Textiles; Wearable technology; Copper-based; Electro-oculogram; Focus detection; Focus games; Game; Human-computer interaction system; Mobile games; OpenBCI; Proof of concept; Wearables; Electrodes","","","","","","","Stiefelhagen R., Yang J., Waibel A., Estimating focus of attention based on gaze and sound, Proceedings of the 2001 Workshop on Perceptive User Interfaces, pp. 1-9, (2001); Li J., Ngai G., Va Leong H., Chan S., Multimodal human attention detection for reading, Proceedings of the 31St Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing, pp. 187-192, (2016); Lin C.-T., Wu S.-L., Jiang W.-L., Jyun-Wei Liang, Chen, S.-A.: A wireless Electrooculography-based human-computer interface for baseball game, 2013 9Th International Conference on Information, Communications & Signal Processing, pp. 1-4, (2013); Kumar D., Sharma A., Electrooculogram-based virtual reality game control using blink detection and gaze calibration, 2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI), pp. 2358-2362, (2016); Wang P., Yang Y., Li J., Development of parkour game system using EEG control, 2018 International Symposium on Computer, Consumer and Control (IS3C), pp. 258-261, (2018); Medical Instrumentation: Application and Design, (2010); Heo J., Yoon H., Park K.S., A novel wearable forehead EOG measurement system for human computer interfaces, Sensors, 17, 7, (2007); Sawangjai P., Hompoonsup S., Leelaarporn P., Kongwudhikunakorn S., Wilaiprasitporn T., Consumer grade EEG measuring sensors as research tools: A review, IEEE Sensors J, 20, pp. 3996-4024, (2020); Wei C.-C., Ma M.-Y., Influences of visual attention and reading time on children and adults, Read.

Capturing player performance and behavior along with details of gameplay directly from the game is a valuable data source for evaluating serious games and for their iterative refinement. In many serious games, the collected data can however be especially sensitive for privacy, as it may imply learning or health state progression, and thus should be strongly protected. In this paper, we specify goals for a security-enhanced game telemetry system, model a security architecture based on them, and present the design of such a system, which we implemented for evaluation of health games in our research group. The presented system is designed to be applicable for various types of serious games. It employs end-to-end encryption, signatures, and data separation to improve protection of collected data without the addition of usability burdens on players from these security measures. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","data security; end-to-end encryption; privacy; serious game analytics; serious game telemetry","Cryptography; Network security; Sensitive data; Telemetering equipment; Data-source; End-to-end encryption; Gameplay; Health state; Iterative refinement; Performance; Privacy; Serious game analytic; Serious game telemetry; Telemetry systems; Serious games","","","","","Carl-Zeiss-Stiftung, CZS","Our research project Senior Health Games is partially funded by the Carl Zeiss Foundation (CZS Transfer program).","Barker E., Chen L., Roginsky A., Vassilev A., Davis R., Recommendation for pair-wise key-establishment schemes using discrete logarithm cryptography.

Serious games that teach detecting and classifying dark patterns, however, have received little attention so far. We present a web-based prototype of such a game targeting adults and the results of a comprehensive user study investigating its effectiveness and knowledge retention among participants. Our findings demonstrate that participants became better at detecting dark patterns, indicating that they became more aware of such design manipulations.

Participants were invited to engage in a simple computer game where their task was to assist others in enhancing their mobility to reach the goal. The primary objective of this study was to determine whether the characteristics of this supportive behavior in the game could predict the participants’ well-being in real life. Participants’ prosociality was evaluated from two perspectives: a subjective evaluation of their prosocial behavior in daily life, as measured by the Altruistic Personality Scale (APS), and the number of assists provided in the game. While controlling for key demographic variables, the study examined the effect of participants’ prosociality on their level of well-being. The results revealed that players who exhibited more prosocial behavior in the game also reported higher levels of well-being outside the game context. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Hierarchical regression model; Prosocial behavior; Well-being","Regression analysis; Daily lives; Demographic variables; Hierarchical regression models; Primary objective; Prosocial behavior; Simple++; Subjective evaluations; Well being; Computer games","","","","","","","Aknin L.B., Et al., Prosocial spending and well-being: Cross-cultural evidence for a psychological universal, J.

Each course chapter is enriched with one mini-game, a gamification module integrated into the e-learning platform and several reminders of the game in the course material. We conducted a study on 117 students to compare their exam results with a control group from last year. We also correlated the collected feedback from the students and usage tracks. This helped us measure the usefulness of specific game elements such as a non-player character that provides help and bonus information modules hidden throughout the mini-games. The preliminary results indicate that the integration of EscapeCell improves students’ learning outcomes in the final exam and that Blob, the virtual tutor, facilitates the usage of the mini-games. Although the bonus information modules do not directly correlate with the final exam result, they show a positive correlation with the scores of the intermediate tests - the multiple-choice questions (MCQs) - taken by the students just after playing the mini-games. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","cellular biology; e-learning platform; gamification; Serious Games; university","Cytology; E-learning; Plants (botany); Students; Cellular biology; Control groups; Course material; E-learning platforms; Game elements; Gamification; Non-player character; Student learning outcomes; Undergraduate students; University; Serious games","","","","","Mohamed Hamza FALIH; Le Mans Université","Funding text 1: Acknowledgements.

Nowadays, organizations utilize self-assessment methodologies to evaluate people or groups to establish productive teams. Even though study has been done on questionnaires and other self-assessment techniques to profile a candidate or an employee, they are frequently mundane and repetitive. In this study, we present a serious 3D Escape Room game with the goal of analyzing behaviors based on the OCEAN Five Personality Traits model. This model encompasses an individual’s behavior on five dimensions: openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. We created corresponding rooms to monitor the player’s gameplay style to develop customized models that assess personalities. These models use gameplay data generated by deep reinforcement learning agents that emulate human behavior, as a ground truth for each trait. Undergraduate and postgraduate students from Greece and Italy took part in our preliminary study and the game results are correlated with the baseline established by weighted questionnaires. The results show that there is indeed a correlation between the profiles from the questionnaires and the game. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","OCEAN Five; Personality Assessment; Reinforcement Learning Agents; Serious Escape Room Game","Behavioral research; Computer aided instruction; Deep learning; Intelligent agents; Reinforcement learning; Serious games; Assessment technique; Gameplay; Human behavior analysis; OCEAN five; Personality assessments; Personality traits; Reinforcement learning agent; Self assessment methodology; Self-assessment; Serious escape room game; Students","","","","","Kapodistrian University; Aristotle University of Thessaloniki","We would like to thank Professor Tsaousis Ioannis from the Kapodistrian University for providing the TPQue questionnaire, associate Professor Panagiotis Gkorezis from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki for assisting in data collection in Greece, and Professor Anna Spagnolli from the University of Padua for her help in data collection in Italy.","McDonald J., Measuring Personality Constructs: The Advantages and Disadvantages of Self-Reports, (2008); Caprara G.V., Barbaranelli C., Borgogni L., Perugini M., The big five questionnaire: A new questionnaire to assess the five factor model, Pers.

This can be achieved, by using suitable metaphors, letting learners get in touch with abstract learning content in an immersive hands-on experience. In order to implement a successful game design that supports the learning content while utilizing the possibilities of VR, a design process is proposed. This process uses conceptual models in order to find suitable metaphors and connecting learning content with game design. The process is demonstrated for two VR learning games that are part of the Inside the System series of CSE serious games. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","computer science education; game design; virtual reality","Design; E-learning; Education computing; Engineering education; Learning systems; Serious games; Virtual reality; Computer Science Education; Conceptual model; Design-process; Game design; Immersive; Interactive learning; Learning contents; Learning experiences; Learning game; System designing; Game design","","","","","Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF","Acknowledgements.

Mastering pharmacophores is essential for pharmaceutical science but this concept is very hard to grasp. This is mainly due to the difficulty of perceiving the three-dimensional aspect of pharmacophore models but also their combinatorial nature. We therefore designed Escape from PharmaZ, a hybrid serious game for undergraduate students. It is composed of a collaborative board game and a dedicated Augmented Reality (AR) smartphone application that allows the students to visualize and manipulate 3D molecular structures. The preliminary tests of this game, with 24 volunteers, show that it helps understand the pharmacophore concept, especially for novices in chemistry. The results also show that the game mechanics and the AR rendering help players better understand the nature of pharmacophore features and the importance of their spatial and combinatorial positioning. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.","augmented reality; collaborative games; in silico drug design; molecules; pharmacophores; serious games","Augmented reality; Game design; Pharmacodynamics; Students; Biological targets; Board games; Collaborative games; Immersive augmented realities; In-silico drug design; Pharmaceutical science; Pharmacophore models; Pharmacophores; Property; Undergraduate students; Serious games","","","","","Bertrand Marne; Bastien Cravi; Université Rennes, (11-LABX-0011); Agence Nationale de la Recherche, ANR, (ANR-21-CE45-0014); Agence Nationale de la Recherche, ANR","This project was financed by Universit\u00E9 Rennes and the project AIR.

Yet, little is known about what players get from such games and how learning takes place, particularly from a collective and structural point of view. This paper summarises and interprets the findings of 4 playtesting sessions of Empaville, a hybrid (digital and physical) Participatory Budgeting (PB) Role-Playing Game (RPG) in which players need to play a character, propose projects for a fictional city and vote for them. By utilising the Activity Theory Model of Serious Games (ATMSG) as a method of analysis, we identified that the core PB collaborative actions were empathy, ideation and decision-making, but these depended on each of the player’s knowledge. We also identified that operationalising actions removes the learning opportunity (e.g., voting) and that sharing physical props was more engaging than sharing digital photos. World-building collaborative mechanisms that emerged were rooted in the structure of the city and access to services (via a shared map), social class and persuasion, and the players’ knowledge of the real-world mechanisms. To conclude, we extend the ATMSG by proposing an analysis of collaboration and cooperation aspects in an SG as opportunities for learning by co-creating worlds. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.","Activity Theory; Civic Participation; Democracy; Participatory Budgeting; Serious Games","Budget control; Collaborative learning; Decision making; Federated learning; Activity Theory; Case-studies; Civic participation; Democracy; Democratic participation; Methods of analysis; Participatory budgeting; Real-world system; Role-playing game; Theory model; Serious games","","","","","EMPATIA H2020; PHOENIX H2020; University of Southampton","The game was supported by\u00A0the EMPATIA H2020 and PHOENIX H2020 grants.

This study explores how students’ preferences for online educational platforms and gamification features vary across genders. We collected data from 406 students in Estonia, including 250 females, 142 males, and 14 others (such as non-binary, gender-neutral), and analyzed their usage patterns and preferences. The results show that platforms like Kahoot and Quizlet are widely favored among all genders. While females tend to prefer badge collection, males and others show a preference for competing with unknown players. However, there is little difference in preferences for point collection across gender groups. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.","Educational Technology; Gamification; Gender; Online Educational Platforms","Adversarial machine learning; Educational technology; Federated learning; Educational platforms; Estonia; Gamification; Gender; Learning platform; Non-binary; Online educational platform; Online learning; Online platforms; Technology in educations; Contrastive Learning","","","","","Research Council of Finland, AKA, (356314)","This work was supported by the Academy of Finland (project no. 356314).","Alas R., Kaarelson T., Gender equality in post-socialist country: Case of estonia, Probl.

This game deals with the topic of the food system and considers how this concept is integrated with the Swiss school curriculum which constituted the starting point of the game design. Based on the ludicization theoretical framework, we question how learning objectives were articulated with the game elements and the choices made to design a playful learning situation. Our work is grounded on a design-based research methodology. In this context, we describe the initial phase of co-design, which involved co-design activities, research of educational content, and iterative prototyping. This empirical work led to the game AL2049, which aims to bring secondary school students (12–15 years old) to understand interrelationships in food systems and, in so doing, to face complex problem solving. Results comprise the game and the choices made in regard to the ludicization model. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Food system; Game design; Gamification; Ludicization; Museum","Iterative methods; Learning systems; Co-designs; Food system; Game design; Game elements; Gamification; Learning game; Learning objectives; Learning situation; Ludicization; Theoretical framework; Game design","","","","","","","Brown J.S., Collins A., Duguid P., Situated cognition and the culture of learning, Educ.

Conventional scoring techniques have severe shortcomings in terms of accuracy and the degree to which actionable information can be drawn from them. In this paper we introduce Cognitive Diagnostic Models and in particular Competence-based Knowledge Space Theory as theoretical underpinnings of in-game competence assessments.

Focusing specifically on growth mindset – a psychological construct associated with learning and resilience – we analyze player-generated reviews on the Steam gaming platform. In particular, reviews were examined using a specifically developed growth mindset dictionary derived from key psychological texts and validated questionnaires. Utilizing over 1 million user-generated reviews across eight distinct game genres, we identified that puzzle, roguelike, and platformer games showed a higher prevalence of growth mindset-related terms when compared to genres that we considered unrelated to growth mindset (e.g., zen, cozy, walking simulator). This aligns well with a growth mindset meaning system, as these genres inherently involve setting objectives, exerting effort, learning from setbacks, and refining strategies through gameplay. In addition, exploratory BERTopic modeling identified four topics with a clear relation to the concept of a growth mindset. These topics emerged differentially across genres with a pattern like the one found with the dictionary, further corroborating our findings. These results confirm theoretical assumptions in the field with a new methodological approach, opening avenues for precisely targeted research on video game effects and informed selection of video game-based interventions. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.","artificial intelligence; growth mindset; natural language processing; text mining; video games","Interactive computer graphics; Feasibility studies; Growth mindset; Language processing; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Novel methods; Psychological effects; Text analysis; Text-mining; Video-games; Natural language processing systems","","","","","","","Granic I., Lobel A., Engels R.C.M.E., The benefits of playing video games, Am.

As organisations evolve, innovative and experiential development methods such as serious games become indispensable but these remain underutilised due to reservations around credibility and return on investment. This study employed the Delphi method to consult a panel of experts in leadership development and serious games design, exploring how serious games can foster the development and application of leadership skills. Three master themes emerged, outlining elements of successful serious games for leadership development: simulated interpersonal dynamics, reinforcement for behavioural adjustment and authenticity of learning experience. Sub-themes included motivation and reward, feedback provision, adaptive learning and personalisation, experience of consequences, competitive versus co-operative environments and simulation of complex decisions. Findings are discussed in relation to Flow theory, Social Constructionism and Identity Theory in order to advance the understanding and implementation of serious leadership games for modern contexts. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.","Flow; Identity; Leadership development; Serious games; Social Constructionism","Contrastive Learning; Business environments; Critical thinking; Delphi method; Digital business; Emotional intelligence; Flow; Identity; Leadership development; Leadership skills; Social constructionism; Game design","","","","","","","Abuhamdeh S., Csikszentmihalyi M., Intrinsic and extrinsic motivational orientations in the competitive context: An examination of person-situation interactions, J.

The study included 46 students from two classes in chemistry. One class with 24 students was included in the experimental study, which employed game-based learning as part of understanding the periodic table. One class with 22 students served as the control group and engaged only in an analog reading of the periodic table. The evaluation consisted of data logging, a knowledge test, a questionnaire with items from the user engagement scale, and interviews with 12 students. The findings revealed the game engaged the students. Students in the experimental gaming group reported significantly higher positive engagement than the control group did. The knowledge test revealed, that in four out of six questions, the gaming group answered more correctly than the control group did. Interestingly, the highest percentage of correct answers was a question linked to a game-designed surprise with an alarm. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","chemistry; engagement; Game-based learning; knowledge test; Serious games; surprise","Serious games; Control groups; Data-logging; Engagement; Game-based Learning; High school students; Knowledge test; Periodic table; Surprize; User engagement; Students","","","","","","","Brecher J., Name=struct: A practical approach to the sorry state of real-life chemical nomenclature, J.

As nursing accounts for over half the healthcare professionals globally, the role is broad in scope, performed in various healthcare settings and across the human lifespan; managing this knowledge is important. To address this problem, this research explores to what extent a serious game could elicit and evaluate specialist nursing knowledge so that it can be preserved beyond its initial use. However, no suitable game was found. Using an elaborated action design research (eADR) approach, this research designed, implemented, and evaluated a serious knowledge elicitation and evaluation game – The Nurse’s Knowledge Bank. In total, three cycles of the game were played by nurses (n = 18) based in an oncology setting. From the three cycles n = 112 evaluated knowledge submissions were captured. These submissions included concepts such as ‘Check patients’ temperature on discharge’ or ‘Ensure patient has their prescription before discharge’. These submissions were mapped into two clinical terminologies, providing a means of sharing this knowledge beyond the clinic border and demonstrating that serious games could potentially have a role in knowledge management. This paper presents an overview of the development and design of the game. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Knowledge Management; Nursing Knowledge; Serious Game","Knowledge management; Nursing; Clinical terminology; Communities of Practice; Design research; Health care professionals; Knowledge bank; Lifespans; Nursing knowledge; Research approach; Serious games","","","","","","","Wenger E., McDermott R.A., Snyder W., Cultivating Communities of Practice: a Guide to Managing Knowledge, (2002); Abt C.C., Serious Games, (1970); Blum B.I., Clinical information systems—a review, West.

The scammer typically lures the victim to an alternative communication method before requesting money under the guise of an urgent situation, such as medical or travel expenses. Victims are left emotionally and financially devastated. Although dating platforms and law enforcement provide information on spotting scammers, it is often text-based and not interactive. We present HeartGuard VR, an immersive, virtual reality (VR) serious game environment which aims to educate the public about romance scams in an engaging manner. This paper describes the game’s design and development, alongside the results of a user evaluation. In the future, it is anticipated the experience will become a publicly available intervention to reduce romance scam victimisation. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.","Romance scams; Serious games; Virtual reality","Computer crime; Crime; Game design; Serious games; Virtual reality; Alternative communication; Communication method; Game environment; Immersive; Immersive virtual reality; Medical expense; Romance scam; Romantic relationship; Social engineering; Travel expense; Virtual environments","","","","","","","Alexiou A., Schippers M.C., Oshri I., Angelopoulos S., Narrative and aesthetics as antecedents of perceived learning in serious games, Inf.

Recently, text generated by large language models (LLMs) has been used to create open-ended text-based game content. However, LLMs have been shown to generate sexist text when trained on gender-biased data. If bias manifests in educational text game affordances it could harm goal achievement. We examine binary gender biases in LIGHT, an English-language persona-based dataset for researching language grounded in a fantasy adventure world, training LLMs on LIGHT and analyzing the diversity of affordances in quests. We find male characters have a more diverse space of affordances yet are less diverse in practice (e.g., mostly wielding a sword) in original and generated quests. To gauge impact on gameplay, we create games from LIGHT quests which can be played in the TextWorld research framework. Artificial agents trained only on male games significantly outperform female, suggesting an impact of affordance biases. These findings illustrate risks in AI- or data-driven generation of serious game content where gender is involved: overlooked biases in affordances can propagate, autonomously enforcing harmful, stereotypical behaviors. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","gender bias; generative ai; text games","Artificial intelligence; Interactive computer graphics; Affordances; English languages; Game contents; Gameplay; Gender bias; Generative ai; Goals achievement; Language model; Role-playing game; Text game; Serious games","","","","","","","Ahn M., Et al., Do as I Can, Not as I Say: Grounding Language in Robotic Affordances.

In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, public health and emergency management organizations are beginning to use such games to enhance their preparedness and readiness activities. In this paper, we present a Knowledge Acquisition Analytical Game (K2AG) focused on understanding and providing training for command, control, coordination, and communication (C3C) functions during an infectious disease outbreak. Unlike traditional game-based exercises, which target strategic, operational and tactical decision making, the K2AG games focus on the cognitive level at which decision-making under uncertainty takes place. Specifically, the C3C Game collects data reflecting the cognitive processes by which players gain situational awareness, make decisions, and take actions. The C3C Game was created through a community-centered design process and leverages methods from human factor engineering, including hierarchical task analysis. This paper describes the game, presents results from a pilot exercise conducting with public health and emergency response decision makers from a large US metropolitan area, and discusses the potential for such games to improve pandemic preparedness and resilience. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Command and Control; Community-Centered Design; Decision Making; Exercise; Human-Centered Design; Pandemic Preparedness; Serious Game","Disease control; Public health; Risk management; Serious games; Command and control; Command control; Community-centered designs; Decisions makings; Emergency management; Exercise; Health management; Human-centred designs; Infectious disease outbreaks; Pandemic preparedness; Decision making","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (2200169)","Keywords: Serious Game · Community-Centered Design · Human-Centered Design · Exercise · Pandemic Preparedness · Decision Making · Command and Control This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 2200169.","Azevedo R., Gasevic D., Analyzing multimodal multichannel data about self-regulated learning with advanced learning technologies: Issues and challenges, Comput.

Previous research in BO uses questionnaires and brain imaging, where the former is a highly subjective metric, and the latter is very costly in time, money, and personnel. To answer the question How can a VR serious game help overcome current challenges of BO assessment?, we designed Astral Body, a VR game that helps cognitive science researchers assess people’s level of BO. In the game, players are asked to grab ‘flying collectibles’ coming from a portal in space. Researchers can inject different types and levels of asynchrony into the arms of the visualized avatar, thus affecting the players’ BO experience and perception. Players, in turn, can also report whenever they perceive possible mismatched avatar behavior. In addition, researchers can analyze player data, including looking for unconscious responses, e.g. small adjustments in physical movements to mitigate injected asynchrony. Preliminary results from playtesting and qualitative analysis of Astral Bodyindicate that a VR game can effectively help researchers investigate BO phenomena. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Body ownership; Control asynchrony; Virtual reality","Brain mapping; Human computer interaction; Interactive computer graphics; Serious games; Asynchrony; Body ownership; Brain imaging; Cognitive science; Control asynchrony; Human movements; Interaction techniques; Real-world; Subjective metric; Visual outputs; Virtual reality","","","","","","","Andreasen A., Nilsson N.C., Serafin S., Spatial asynchronous Visuo-Tactile stimuli influence ownership of virtual wings, IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces (VR), pp. 503-504, (2018); Botvinick M., Cohen J., Rubber hands ‘feel’ touch that eyes see, Nature, 391, 6669, pp. 756-756, (1998); Bourdin P., Martini M., Sanchez-Vives M.V., Altered visual feedback from an embodied avatar unconsciously influences movement amplitude and muscle activity, Sci.

Within this framework, contemporary media platforms like virtual reality (VR) still maintain an element of novelty in public perception, thereby serving as a catalyst to engage individuals in cultural knowledge. Drawing on these assumptions, this paper introduces our serious game, Yabusame!!! - a collaborative endeavor between our team and the esteemed city museum, Hornmoldhaus, developed during the Coding da Vinci Hackathon for cultural data (https://codingdavinci.de/en/node ). The game, a VR bow shooting experience, creatively imparts the contents of a historical Japanese cross scroll that portrays the eponymous Japanese sport, Yabusame, alongside associated historical and cultural knowledge. The game design encompassed deliberate strategies aimed at optimizing usability and mitigating potential causes of motion sickness, ensuring the practical applicability of the game within the corresponding museum exhibition. This paper unfolds in three parts: firstly, an exposition of the cultural backdrop behind the game; secondly, an exploration of our didactic strategy, game design choices, and our vision for seamlessly integrating the VR game within a museum exhibition; and finally, the presentation of a study we conducted to examine the practical usability of Yabusame!!! in this setting. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Serious Game Development Report; Usability Study; VR-supported Cultural Asset Presentation","Game design; Historic preservation; Museums; Serious games; Software design; Cultural assets; Cultural heritages; Cultural knowledge; Digital technologies; Game design; Media platforms; Serious game development; Serious game development report; Usability studies; Virtual reality-supported cultural asset presentation; Virtual reality","","","","","","","Giannini T., Bowen J.P., Rethinking museum exhibitions: Merging physical and digital culture—past to present, Museums and Digital Culture.

The players, their willingness to play the game, and the games’ effects on them are crucial in the design and development of games and serious games. The established concepts and methods for research and design of user experience constitute a reasonable starting point for locating methods to employ when designing and developing serious games. To identify gaps and form a research agenda, we adopted grounded theory-based literature review as a method to research the current state of UX concept integration in serious games’ development. While integrating evaluation methods is well under-way, there is still significant unfulfilled potential around user research and design. In particular, lacking awareness of existing research concepts and methods poses a significant hurdle. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Gamification; Research Agenda; Serious Games; Usability; User Experience","Electric grounding; Game design; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Product design; Business contexts; Design and Development; Design-process; Education healths; Gamification; Grounded theory; Research agenda; Research process; Usability; Users' experiences; Serious games","","","","","","","Moizer J., An approach to evaluating the user experience of serious games, Comput.

However, interventions specifically targeting AI ethics are scarce, as are those using game-based learning in AI literacy education, presenting an opportunity to explore the potential of game-based learning for teaching AI ethics. In this paper, we report the results of a pilot study in which we investigated the usefulness of a game-based learning environment titled MediaWatch - AI Ethics. The game was designed to foster an understanding of AI ethics. The study was conducted with 40 Finnish 9th-grade students who played MediaWatch - AI Ethics for about ten minutes during the regular school day. Pre-and post-test measurements were used to assess changes in students’ understanding of AI ethics and epistemic curiosity, while in-game measurements were used to examine self-efficacy and epistemic curiosity during gameplay. The findings revealed that even a short duration of gameplay can positively influence students’ understanding of AI ethics, suggesting that game-based learning is a promising approach to AI ethics education. However, the game did not significantly impact students’ epistemic curiosity or self-efficacy. The results contribute to the discussion of approaches to foster AI literacy and encourage further exploration of game-based learning in AI ethics instruction. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.","AI ethics; AI literacy; game-based learning; learning outcomes; secondary education","Adversarial machine learning; Ethical technology; Federated learning; AI ethic; AI literacy; AI Technologies; Epistemic curiosities; Game-based Learning; Gameplay; Learning outcome; Secondary education; Self efficacy; Technology advances; Contrastive Learning","","","","","Strategic Research Council, RSF, (358250)","This study was supported by the Strategic Research Council (grant: 358250).","Vinuesa R., Et al., The role of artificial intelligence in achieving the sustainable development goals, Nat.

To achieve this goal, we analyzed eye gaze data collected non-invasively using low-grade webcams from 28 participants working for the port authority of the Port of Rotterdam and 66 students. Such data were used for a classification task implemented using a MiniRocket classifier, an algorithm used for time-series classification. The classifier reached an F1 score of 0.75 (SD = 0.07), a PR AUC of 0.73 (SD = 0.14), and an ROC AUC of 0.75 (SD = 0.15) providing evidence that it is possible to identify real-life experts about maritime port management using data that can be obtained from a webcam. We speculate that the gaze direction used to train the MiniRocket may contain relevant information about the cognitive processes and decisions occurring throughout the gameplay. We suggest that the methods here presented not only can be used to detect experts playing simulations, such as serious games, but also to identify experts tackling screen-presented tasks. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.","Expertise; Gaze; Machine Learning; Maritime Port; Serious Games; Sustainability; Time Series Classification","Information management; Sprockets; Expertise; Gaze; Gaze direction; Lay peoples; Machine-learning; Maritime port; Port areas; Port authorities; Time series classifications; WebCams; Students","","","","","Ministry of Economic Affairs and Municipality of Tilburg","This research is founded by the MasterMinds project, part of the RegionDeal Mid- and West-Brabant, and it is co-founded by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Municipality of Tilburg.","Alagoz C., Robust and efficient atrial fibrillation detection from intracardiac electrograms using MiniRocket, Int.

However, traditional research in quality of experience (QoE) relies on the subjective ratings of a multimedia consumption experience under a lab-based environment without distractions. To make the collected QoE ratings closer to realistic usage scenarios we designed a browser-based game as an adapted QoE subjective test that can incorporate and quantify cognitive effort using a dual-task paradigm. Our pilot study results show that our proposed browser-based game is a viable protocol that can control for, and reflect, the cognitive effort via selected self-reported measures given an appropriate load range. Future work will further standardise and simplify the game protocol for robustness, repeatability and test duration. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Cognitive Effort; Dual-task Paradigm; Listening Effort; Quality of Experience (QoE)","Quality control; Quality of service; Cognitive efforts; Dual-task paradigm; Dual-tasks; Experience evaluation; Game design; Listening effort; Pilot studies; Quality of experience; Subjective rating; Usage scenarios; Game design","","","","","","","Leeuw J.R., jsPsych: A JavaScript library for creating behavioral experiments in a Web browser, Behavior Research Methods, 47, 1, pp. 1-12, (2014); Hunter C.R., Tracking cognitive spare capacity during speech perception with eeg/erp: Effects of cognitive load and sentence predictability, Ear and Hearing, pp. 1144-1157, (2020); 800, (1996); Johnsrude I.S., Rodd J.M., Factors that increase processing demands when listening to speech, Neurobiology of Language, Pp. 491–502.

Rehabilitation is often long-term work that requires many repetitions and home training with parents. Therefore, one of the most important tasks of paediatric speech-language pathologists (SLPs) is to find different ways, over and over again, to motivate children for training. As different types of games themselves have already been identified as important motivational tools used by SLPs, the purpose of this study was to investigate what kind of gamification elements SLPs use in therapy, in addition to the games themselves, to motivate children for training. 26 Finnish SLPs responded to an online questionnaire consisting of four open-ended questions. Our results indicate that SLPs typically use several different motivational methods, which they aim to personalize as much as possible to individually support motivation. SLPs make a special effort to increase children’s intrinsic motivation by employing motivational features commonly used in gamification, such as playfulness, the child’s own interests, and goal setting. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Gamification; Motivation; Speech Therapy; Survey","Patient rehabilitation; Pediatrics; Finnish; Gamification; Goal-setting; Intrinsic motivation; Online questionnaire; Open-ended questions; Speech language pathologists; Speech therapy; Motivation","","","","","","","Filgona J., Sakiyo J., Gwany D.M., Okoronka A.U., Motivation in learning, Asian J.

Serious games have proven to be an efficient tool for enhancing teachers’ training, providing immersive and interactive learning experiences, and allowing teachers to develop classroom management strategies in a risk-free environment. We present the design and implementation of BlendMaster, a collaborative board game for training teachers in BL. The game challenges players to make decisions, addressing classroom challenges in both face-to-face and online settings. By exploring the game’s mechanics, dynamics, and aesthetics, we foster reflection on BL while creating an engaging experience.

In this paper, we discuss the design of a serious choice-driven simulation game, called “Covid-19 Survivor”, as a means to empower students’ awareness of pandemic risks and consequences through decision making and system analysis. The online game simulates the daily routine of a school student through a system of available choices and consequences to five game fields. We qualitatively evaluated the game in a classroom setting with twenty-six 13 years old students and one IT teacher. The preliminary results demonstrate its potential to influence students’ perceptions and knowledge about the pandemic as well as to enhance their decision-making and systems thinking skills. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Covid-19; Educational games; Qualitative study; Simulation games; Students’ behavior","Game design; Health risks; Risk assessment; Students; Systems thinking; Covid-19; Decision systems; Decisions makings; Design and evaluations; Educational game; Qualitative study; Simulation games; Social isolation; Student experiences; Students' behaviors; Decision making","","","","","","","de Figueiredo C.S., Et al., COVID-19 pandemic impact on children and adolescents’ mental health: Biological, environmental, and social factors, Prog.

Therefore, we analysed and compared a digital and analogue version of a simulation game for port management regarding their validity, play(er) experience, and learning outcomes. Our results showed that engagement is one of the key factors for learning, but that simulation games need to be realistic enough to also guarantee specific learning outcomes.

However, practices of debriefing vary depending on the objectives and the context. With the advent of new virtual reality simulations, it is interesting to identify methods of debriefing for the trainer and learner in this situation. This paper provides a global review of debriefing in a serious game context and considers the findings tied to a virtual reality context. The purpose of this analysis is to find a proper solution and to use virtual reality technology to improve the debriefing experience. We finally propose a tool for virtual reality simulations that provides an immersive debriefing system that includes a replay system of the simulation occurred as well as a possibility to restart at any moment of the replay. As such, we think that the participant can have a better understanding and reflection of what he/she has experienced as well as a possibility to explore other choices. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Debriefing; Game engine; Simulation; Virtual reality","Virtual reality; Debriefing; Game Engine; Immersive; Proper solutions; Simulation; Virtual reality simulations; Virtual reality technology; Serious games","","","","","","","Sawyer T., Et al., More than one way to debrief, Simul.

It is a simulation of a public blockchain, mostly similar to Bitcoin. Each player acts as a node with all possibilities of creating coin-transactions and blocks as well as the capability to experience the consensus algorithm by checking transactions and blocks. Bloxxgame supports experience-based instruction of blockchain concepts and can be used in class or for online teaching. Moreover, the simulation offers students the opportunity to experiment with all relevant operations of a blockchain such as signing, creating transactions, block building, etc. In this paper, we aim to share our practical experiences from teaching the emerging technology of blockchain to business or business information technology students on Bachelor and Master level applying a newly developed gamified teaching approach.

Therefore, the aim of this research is to analyze the perception of high school teachers on the potential integration of mobile learning based on the use of Microcosmos® 3.0. The results show that teachers are highly interested in mobile learning, partially know how to use it, despite access limitations, and are positively willing to train and participate in this new learning methodology. They admit that there are benefits of Microcosmos® 3.0 for learning Natural Sciences, especially chemistry, biology, entomology and anatomy; however, they accept that the challenges are somehow difficult, but can be improved by its constant use. Likewise, they admit a high level of satisfaction and usefulness for the reinforcement of contents and that continuity in the coming years will depend on the fulfillment of some of the suggestions made. Future studies will seek a more exhaustive follow-up and will include students as part of the sample. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","High school; Hybrid playing; Mobile learning; Natural sciences; Teachers","E-learning; Learning systems; Follow up; High school teachers; Higher School; Hybrid playing; Level of satisfaction; Mobile Learning; Teachers'; Teaching process; Technology transfer","","","","","","","Montoya M.S., Recursos tecnológicos para el aprendizaje móvil (mlearning) y su relación con los ambientes de educación a distancia: Implementaciones e investigaciones, RIED.

However, these products are very costly, and many people cannot afford them using their own savings. There exist several options for funding these projects, but people do not take advantage of such due to lack of information and the common negative view on using external funding. Psychological objections on taking loans include future time perspective, perception of short time rewards and connotation of loans itself. This paper presents a serious game aimed at changing people’s mindset on taking loans to retrofit energy into their homes; Supreme Green Time Machine is a tycoon game in which you can acquire energy-saving products for your home. A main mechanic in the game is the opportunity to take loans to fund the purchase of these upgrades. Combined with other underlying mechanics, such as the time progress and social feedback, the game targets the different psychological objections to long term loans for home retrofitting. From a preliminary evaluation, we conclude that Supreme Green Time Machine effectively succeeds in making players more positive towards using loans to retrofit their homes. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Energy finance; Future time perspective; Home retrofitting; Persuasive games; Serious games; Sustainability","Energy conservation; Purchasing; Retrofitting; External funding; Future time perspectives; Social feedbacks; Time machine; Time progress; Serious games","","","","","","","Appel Y., Et al., 11899, pp. 394-403, (2019); Bang M., Torstensson C., Katzeff C., The powerhhouse: A persuasive computer game designed to raise awareness of domestic energy consumption, PERSUASIVE 2006.

Since technical measures currently fall short of preventing phishing attacks completely, educating end-users is an important factor in reducing the risk of successful attacks. Here, game-based learning has emerged as a scalable, motivational educational approach. While learning games that focus on phishing emails have been created in the past, they mainly include simple game mechanics, which do not map to the complex decisions that are involved in recognizing malicious emails. To this end, we present a novel anti-phishing learning game, consisting of two different game modes: Either, players have to create phishing emails from given templates themselves, or they have to analyze emails for malicious cues and mark relevant parts. The game is designed for a broad target group of adult users with little to no prior knowledge about phishing. To facilitate immersion, the game content is generated automatically and allows for personalization. This paper presents the design, implementation, and a preliminary usability evaluation of the game. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Email; Game-based learning; Personalization; Phishing","Computer crime; Risk assessment; Anti-phishing; Email; End-users; Game-based Learning; Learning game; Online security; Personalizations; Phishing; Phishing attacks; Technical measures; Electronic mail","","","","","","","Phishing Attack Trends Report, 1St Quarter, 2022, (2022); Cialdini R.B., Influence: the Psychology of Persuasion, (2006); Das A., Baki S., El Aassal A., Verma R., Dunbar A., SoK: A comprehensive reex-amination of phishing research from the security perspective, IEEE Commun.

Although studies showed positive benefits of using digital educational games compared to other teaching methods, a systematic assessment of the effectiveness of digital games for learning is lacking. In this paper, we reflect on two intervention studies in which we investigated the effectiveness of digital games for learning with integrated adaptivity. Based on this work, we propose an extension of the framework of All and colleagues [5] for assessing digital games for learning including cognitive, noncognitive, and efficiency outcomes. We added aspects of study design that need to be considered such as learner, intervention, and measurement characteristics. The validation and adoption of this framework may contribute to more standardized procedures to assess the effectiveness of digital games for learning. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Digital games for learning; Effectiveness; Methodologies","E-learning; Learning systems; Digital game for learning; Digital games; Effectiveness; Games for learning; Immediate feedbacks; Item difficulties; Learn+; Learning contents; Methodology; Performance; Computer games","","","","","","","Nelson G., McMaster K.L., The effects of early numeracy interventions for students in preschool and early elementary: A meta-analysis, J.

The novella is mandatory reading in postmodernism. The study included 41 students from two Danish gymnasiums, who were divided into three classes. Two classes were included in the experimental study, which employed the serious game as part of reading the novella. One class served as the control group and engaged only in an analog reading of the novella. The evaluation criteria, which were assessed through a questionnaire, were based on items from the reading engagement index, the user engagement scale, and the narrative engagement scale. Furthermore, the evaluation consisted of in-depth interviews with teachers and students. The findings revealed a positive effect on students’ engagement in the experimental group and the possibility for future work in the field of serious games implemented in high school curricula. The serious game developed for this study balanced challenge and skills appropriately, but it could be improved in terms of the story world and controls. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Game design; Reading engagement; Serious games; Storytelling","Curricula; Game design; Gymnasiums; Students; Control groups; Evaluation criteria; Experimental groups; Game design; In-depth interviews; Reading engagement; Storytelling; Student engagement; Teachers'; User engagement; Serious games","","","","","","","PISA 2018 Results, 3, (2019); Hamilton P.L., Jones L., Illuminating the ‘boy problem’ from children’s and teachers’ perspectives: A pilot study, Education, 44, 3, pp. 241-254, (2016); Statistics Denmark: Karaktergennemsnittet Stiger for Alle Grupper Af Studenter [Grade Differences for All Groups of Students, (2021); Baron N.S., Words Onscreen: The Fate of Reading in an Online World, (2015); Twenge J.M., Martin G.N., Spitzberg B.H., Trends in US Adolescents’ media use, 1976– 2016: The rise of digital media, the decline of TV, and the (near) demise of print, Psychol.

The goal is to use it to implement a non-player vehicle in serious games for driving. The agent extends a Deep Q Learning agent developed by Eduard Leurent in Stable Baselines by adding rewards in order to better meet the traffic laws. The motorway environment was enhanced as well, in order to increase realism. A multilayer perceptron model, processing cinematic inputs from the ego and other vehicles, was tested in different traffic conditions and outperformed the original model and other policies such as a heuristic and a minimal-reward one. Our experience stresses the importance of defining episode metrics to assess agent behavior, keeping into accounts factors related to safety (e.g., keeping a safe time to collision) and consumption (e.g., limiting accelerations and decelerations). This is key to define rewards and penalties able to properly train the model to meet the traffic laws while keeping a high-speed performance. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Automotive driving; Autonomous agents; Deep Q learning; Metrics; Reinforcement learning; Rewards and penalties; Serious games; Stable baselines","Autonomous agents; Deep learning; Learning algorithms; Serious games; Vehicles; Automated vehicles; Automotive driving; Deep Q learning; Metric; Q-learning; Reinforcement learning agent; Reward and penalty; Simple++; Stable baseline; Traffic laws; Reinforcement learning","","","","","","","Massoud R., Berta R., Poslad S., de Gloria A., Bellotti F., IoT sensing for reality-enhanced serious games, a fuel-efficient drive use case, Sensors, 21, 10, (2021); Dosovitskiy A., Ros G., Codevilla F., Lopez A., Koltun V., CARLA: An Open Urban driving simulator, 1St Conference on Robot Learning (Corl, (2017); Carla Community: Carla Simulator.

According to a literature review about serious game design, a key process for collaborative work is knowledge sharing. This process is analysed with the frames of praxeologies and boundary objects. The praxeology framework aims to identify the participants’ practice and discourse about this practice for the design of serious games. The boundary objects framework aims to identify knowledge transactions during collaborative work. We collected data from workshops dedicated to co-design of TSADK, a serious game for computer education. We performed a thematic analysis on participants’ verbatim for nine workshops. The thematic analysis focuses on one subject: the learning outcomes of the game. The analysis has identified themes on this subject: to specify, to phrase and to select the main learning outcomes. Regarding these themes, the praxeology and boundary object frameworks allow us to identify common practice but no common knowledge and thus, an obstacle to collaboration. Based on these results, we propose a tool for supporting the collaboration design through sharing knowledge. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Boundary object; Co-design; Praxeology; Serious game; Share knowledge","Design; E-learning; Game design; Knowledge management; Boundary objects; Co-designs; Collaborative Work; Digital learning games; Knowledge-sharing; Learning outcome; Praxeologies; Share knowledge; Supporting knowledge; Thematic analysis; Serious games","","","","","TSADK; Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF, (NRP 77)","Funding text 1: This research is part of the co.LAB project, funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (NRP 77).

Evidence shows that math anxiety negatively affects the ability to solve mathematical tasks. Game-based learning has proven to be an effective approach to improve attitudes toward math. This study looked at the effects of a game-based version of a fraction estimation task on math anxiety and estimation performance when directly compared to a non-game-based task version. Participants aged 18–25-years-old were assessed on their math anxiety levels before and after completing both task versions. Changes in reported math anxiety levels through completion of either the game-based or non-game-based version were then compared. Analyses indicated no significant difference in the change of math anxiety (nor state anxiety as a control variable), nor significant differences in estimation performance due to task version. This seems to indicate no significant influence of game-based presentation of the fraction estimation task on reported math anxiety. Nevertheless, it needs to be considered that levels of math anxiety were generally low in our sample of university students. The current study can be considered a first step toward systematically investigating effects of game-based learning approaches on math anxiety. Accordingly, current results call for further research on a more math-anxious sample to investigate the potential benefits of a game-based task version on math anxiety and fraction estimation performance. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Fractions; Game-based learning; Math; Math anxiety; Number line","'current; Anxiety levels; Estimation performance; Fraction; Fraction estimation; Game-Based; Game-based Learning; Math; Math anxiety; Number line","","","","","","","Aarnos E., Perkkila P., Early signs of mathematics anxiety?, Proc. – Soc.

For example, SGs provide immersive learning environments, where risky or complex scenarios can be tested in safety while keeping players engaged. Moreover, the highly interactive nature of serious games opens new opportunities for applying learning analytics to the interaction data gathered from the gameplays. These interaction data can be used, for example, to measure the impact of serious games on their players. At e-UCM, we have developed open code tools to support serious game learning analytics (GLA), especially an xAPI tracker that collects the player interactions and sends them to a cloud analytic store, SIMVA. Although this tracker uses the xAPI specification as a basis, it includes extensions tailored to our tools. However, not all game developers have the knowledge to operate our analytics infrastructure or are willing to use our tools. We present the design of a GLA system based on existing software modules, focused on collecting and storing analytics generated by SGs in xAPI format. The main elements of this lean architecture are the Learning Record Store (LRS) and the xAPI tracker. With this work, we aim to facilitate and lower the barrier of applying learning analytics in serious games. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Game learning analytics; Serious games; Tracker; xAPI","Computer aided instruction; Analytics systems; Game learning analytic; Gameplay; Immersive learning; Learning environments; Learning record; Open codes; Software modules; Tracker; XAPI; Serious games","","","","","European Structural Funds FSE; Regional Government of Madrid, (S2018/TCS4307); Ministry of Education, MOE, (PID2020-119620RB-I00, TIN2017-89238-R); Federación Española de Enfermedades Raras, FEDER","Acknowledgements.

The resulting teaching or training activities are however difficult to assess. To set up a model to allow evaluating these activities, we choose to enrich an existing grid, that was developed in 2006 by Sara de Freitas and Martin Oliver, centered on pedagogical considerations. We propose to add dimensions relating to the game, the humans involved, and their interactions with the game. The resulting grid takes into account COntext, LEarner, Course scenario, Teacher, plaY aNd Game, making the Colectyng framework. The model was confronted to literature to see if we could complete the grid and whether all elements could fit in the model. Altogether our analysis suggest that the colectyng framework acts as a meta-model that could give a general view and could facilitate the articulation between more specialized models. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Evaluation; Game-based learning","Computer science; Computers; Educational context; Game-based Learning; Meta model; Training activities; Artificial intelligence","","","","","French Agency for Research ANR-11-LABX-0011","Supported by the French Agency for Research ANR-11-LABX-0011 (AT).","All A., Castellar E.P.N., van Looy J., Towards a conceptual framework for assessing the effectiveness of digital game-based learning, Comput.

However, little is known about the nature of emotions in game-based learning. We extended previous game-based learning research by examining epistemic emotions and their relations to flow experience and situational interest. Sixty-eight 15–18-year-old students played the Antidote COVID-19 game for 25 min. Epistemic emotions, flow, and situational interest were measured after the playing session. These measures indicated that the game engaged students. Students reported significantly higher intensity levels of positive epistemic emotions (excitement, surprise, and curiosity) than negative epistemic emotions (boredom, anxiety, frustration, and confusion). The co-occurrence network analyses provided insights into the relationship between flow and situational interest. We found an asymmetrical pattern of the “situational interest-flow” co-occurrence. When situational interest occurred, the flow was always co-occurring. This co-occurrence suggests that situational interest could be a prerequisite or a potential trigger for flow experience but not an adequate state ensuring a high flow experience. Further, flow and situational interest co-occurred mainly with positive epistemic emotions. The findings imply that flow and situational interest are similar constructs and share several characteristics. The study also demonstrated that epistemic emotions, flow, and situational interest can be used as proxies of engagement. Implications of the findings are discussed. © 2022, The Authors.","Engagement; Epistemic emotions; Flow experience; Game-based learning; Situational interest","Students; Co-occurrence; Co-occurrence networks; Engagement; Epistemic emotion; Flow experience; Game-based Learning; Health literacy; High intensity; Intensity levels; Situational interest; COVID-19","","","","","Strategic Research Council, RSF; UK Research and Innovation, UKRI, (103641)","This research is funded by the Strategic Research Council (SRC).","Loderer K., Pekrun R., Plass J.L., Emotional foundations of game-based learning, Handbook of Game-Based Learning, pp. 111-151, (2020); Ninaus M., Et al., Increased emotional engagement in game-based learning–a machine learning approach on facial emotion detection data, Comput.

We propose a new architecture for behavioural planning of vehicles, that decide their motion taking high-level decisions, such as “keep lane”, “overtake” and “go to rightmost lane”. This is similar to a driver’s high-level reasoning and takes into account the availability of ever more sophisticated Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS) in current vehicles. Compared to a low-level decision making system, our model performs better both in terms of safety and average speed. As a significant advantage, the hierarchical approach allows to reduce the number of training steps, which is critical for ML models, by more than one order of magnitude. The developed agent seems to show a more realistic behaviour. We also showed feasibility of training models able to differentiate their performance in a way similar to the driving styles. We believe that such agents could be profitably employed in state of the art SGs for driving, improving the realism of single NPVs and overall traffic. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","ADAS; Automotive driving; Autonomous agents; Driving games; PPO; Racing games; Reinforcement learning; Serious games","Advanced driver assistance systems; Automobile drivers; Autonomous agents; Behavioral research; Decision making; Serious games; Advanced driving assistance system; Automotive driving; Decisions makings; Driver modelling; Driving assistance systems; Driving game; Driving styles; Non-players; Racing game; Reinforcement learnings; Reinforcement learning","","","","","","","Massoud R., Berta R., Poslad S., de Gloria A., Bellotti F., IoT sensing for reality-enhanced serious games, a fuel-efficient drive use case, Sensors, 21, (2021); Nousias S., Et al., Exploiting gamification to improve eco-driving behaviour: The GamECAR approach, Electron.

However, obscure data processing often leads to tedious decision-making and results in unreflective choices that unduly compromise privacy. Serious Games could be applied to encourage teenagers and young adults to make more thoughtful privacy decisions. Creating a Serious Game (SG) that promotes privacy awareness while maintaining an engaging gameplay requires, however, a carefully balanced game concept. This study explores the benefits of an online role-playing boardgame as a co-designing activity for creating SGs about privacy. In a between-subjects trial, student groups and educator/researcher groups were taking the roles of player, teacher, researcher and designer to co-design a balanced privacy SG concept. Using predefined design proposal cards or creating their own, students and educators played the online boardgame during a video conference session to generate game ideas, resolve potential conflicts and balance the different SG aspects. The comparative results of the present study indicate that students and educators alike perceive support from role-playing when ideating and balancing SG concepts and are happy with their playfully co-designed game concepts. Implications for supporting SG design with role-playing in remote collaboration scenarios are conclusively synthesised. © 2021, The Author(s).","Design card set; Digital boardgame; Online co-design; Privacy; Remote co-creation; Role play; Serious game design","Behavioral research; Data handling; Decision making; Game design; Social networking (online); Students; Co-creation; Co-designs; Design card set; Digital boardgame; Online co-design; Privacy; Remote co-creation; Role playing; Role-plays; Serious games designs; Serious games","","","","","NFR, (270969)","Acknowledgements.

Although ludification ties in with both gamification and the concept and practice of transmedia it possesses unique characteristics and qualities of its own, primarily evolving around playful ways of creating and interacting with stories. The focus point is especially how traditional media such as tv-series and movies incorporate game-like structures into their narrative structure. This concerns both the narrative structures that users can and cannot interact with. Among other things, we consider a deep understanding of ludification vital for the more practically oriented approach to learning through (serious) games and game mechanics. Thus, this paper serves as a prolegomenon to the interpretation of works of ludification, as well as to the diverse field of deploying ludified material in didactical and pedagogical context. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Game design; Gamification; Learning; Ludification; Play theory","Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Diverse fields; Focus points; Narrative structures; Gamification","","","","","","","Bogost I., Why gamification is bullshit, The Gameful World, (2014); Caillois R., Man, Play and Games, (2001); Csikszentmihalyi M., Beyond Boredom and Anxiety – Experiencing Flow in Work and Play, (2000); Deterding S., Sicart M., Nacke L., O'Hara K., Dixon D., Gamification: Using game design elements in non-gaming contexts, CHI 2011, (2011); Dippel A., Fizek S., Ludification of Culture, The Significance of play and games in everyday practices of the digital era, Digitalization: Theories and Concepts for Empirical Cultural Research, (2017); Frissen V., Lammes S., de Lange M., de Mul J., Raessens J., Playful Identities: The Ludification of Digital Media Cultures, (2015); Gadamer H.G., Truth and Method, (2013); Grimes S.M., Feenberg A., Rationalizing play: A critical theory of digital gaming, The Information Society, 25, pp. 105-118, (2009); Hopson J., Behavioral Game Design in Gamasutra, (2001); Huizinga J., Homo Ludens: A Study of the Play-Element in Culture, (2014); Hunicke R., Leblanc M., Zubek R., MDA: A Formal Approach to Game Design and Game Research, (2004); Huotari K., Hamari J., Gamification” from the perspective of service marketing, CHI 2011, (2011); Jenkins H., Ford S., Green J., Spreadable Media, (2013); Jenkins H., Convergence Culture – Where Old and New Media Collide, (2006); Kerr A., Kucklich J., Brereton P., New media – new pleasures?, Int.

GamesHUB is an example where an interdisciplinary team combined their theoretical backgrounds to think, design, and create with a clear view to learning. After several assessments of teachers’ perceptions that helped to design GamesHUB in an iterative and agile process, this paper finally presents the first documented tests of the learning platform in four K-12 classrooms (N = 76). An adapted E-gameFlow—simplified for 8- to 10-year-old students—was used to evaluate the learning experience and satisfaction. Results indicate that self-reported concentration, perceived challenge, autonomy, and immersion were considered high. The reported experience through drawings and keywords adds to the hypothesis that GamesHUB is generating flow. However, these results need to be expended to confirm the impact and help the next steps of development. It invites the designing team to keep a similar layout and a similar student experience in the future development and tests of GamesHUB. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","e-learning; Flow assessment; Game-based learning","E-learning; Agile process; E - learning; Flow assessment; Game-based Learning; Interdisciplinary teams; IT solution; Iterative process; Learning platform; Platform design; Teachers' perceptions; Students","","","","","","","Meyer A., Rose D.H., Gordon D., Universal Design for Learning: Theory and Practice, (2014); Karoui A., Et al., Adaptive pathways within the european platform for personalized language learning PEAPL, Adjunct Proceedings of the 29Th ACM Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation and Personalization, pp. 90-94, (2021); Alvarez L., Karoui A., Geoffre T., Rodi M., Dherbey-Chapuis N., Promoting universal design for learning through digital assistive tools in GamesHUB, Educating for a New Future: Making Sense of Technology-Enhanced Learning Adoption: 17Th European Conference on Technology Enhanced Learning, EC-TEL 2022, Toulouse, France, September 12–16, 2022, Proceedings, pp. 421-426, (2022); Karoui A., Et al., Towards an Automated Adaptive Learning Web Platform through Personalization of Language Learning Pathways, (2022); Siemieniec R., Mente R., 600 V Power Device Technologies for Highly Efficient Power supplies,º in 2021 23Rd European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications; Karoui A., Et al., Adaptive pathways within the european platform for personalized language learning PEAPL, UMAP 2021-Adjunct Publication of the 29Th ACM Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation and Personalization, Pp. 90–94, (2021); Alvarez L., Carrupt R., Audrin C., Gay P., Self-reported flow in online learning environments for teacher education: A quasi-experimental study using a counterbalanced design, Educ.

Particularly, some paradigms have been defined, rooted in the Game Theory, that use socio-economic and/or trust based contexts to produce specific emotional responses in people. However, experiments with such game paradigms have most frequently been carried out in controlled settings only. As these methods have a potential usefulness in a variety of areas, we are interested in verifying their applicability “in the wild”. To this end, we have developed a mobile game that integrates in a single plot four of the above mentioned socio-economic and trust-based game paradigms and aims at eliciting specific types and valences of emotions in different interactions. The paper discusses the outcomes of an experiment we carried out with eight participants in order to preliminarily test the usability of our game in authentic contexts of use. The results confirm that the designed game interactions are able to elicit emotional responses in the participants, also in ecological settings, that were expected based on the literature. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Affective computing; Emotion elicitation; Game theory; Serious games","Behavioral research; Computation theory; Decision making; Decision theory; Game theory; Affective Computing; Authentic contexts; Context of use; Decisions makings; Emotion elicitation; Emotional response; Empirical research; Mobile games; Socio-economics; Theoretical research; Serious games","","","","","","","23+ Mobile Gaming Statistics for 2022-Insights into a $175B Games Market; Siemieniec R., Mente R., 600 V Power Device Technologies for Highly Efficient Power supplies,º in 2021 23Rd European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications; Arnab S., Et al., Mapping learning and game mechanics for serious games analysis, Br.

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether Number Navigation Game (NNG) promotes deliberate practice and how the game performance profiles relate to Adaptive Number Knowledge (ANK) development, perceived challenge, flow, and math interest. NNG is a game-based learning environment that requires students to progress by making more complex arithmetic solutions, which is particularly important to promote ANK. Game performances of 214 Finnish students require not only addition and subtraction but also multiplication and division operations were compiled and compared to the best performance possible for each level. A growth mixture model based on students’ relative performance levels was employed to offer insight into the changes in students’ game performance throughout the game, and the relations of students’ game performance with knowledge gains, perceived challenge, math motivation, and flow. We identified four profiles of students’ game performance. The largest profile steadily enhanced their performance in playing the game despite having lower-than-average initial performance. This group experienced lower flow and larger learning gains than other groups, which suggests their engagement may be more aligned with deliberate practice. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Adaptive number knowledge; Deliberate practice; Game-based learning; Gaming analytics; Mathematics","Computer aided instruction; Education computing; Adaptive expertise; Adaptive number knowledge; Deliberate practices; Game-based Learning; Game-based learning environments; Gaming analytic; Knowledge development; Mathematics education; Performance; Performance profile; Students","","","","","Academy of Finland, AKA, (312528, 336068); Academy of Finland, AKA","Acknowledgments.

Recognised as a comprehensive regulation for improving privacy and data protection, a substantial impact on data processing disciplines such as Serious Games (SG) research was expected. By conducting a scoping review, this paper explores the effects of GDPR on reporting of ethics approval, informed consent, ethics guidelines and data protection in SG studies. Five scientific databases were searched for research between 2016 and 2020 addressing Serious Games, Exergames and Applied Games. A total of 2146 full-text studies split into equal collections before and after GDPR were included. Lexicometric and keyword-in-context analysis were conducted and comparatively evaluated regarding ethics reporting and trends. Results unexpectedly show that GDPR so far hardly left a mark. While a slight increase of 12% in general ethics reporting can be observed, less than 6% of the studies after GDPR coming-into-force report on data protection. Ethics procedures remained consistent with most researchers reporting the approval from their home university committee and stating the Declaration of Helsinki as followed guidelines. Overall, the verifiable impact of GDPR was found negligibly small, with only 0.5% of studies referring to the regulation in the two years after introduction. Conclusively, further research is suggested to focus on integrating ethics and data protection guided on GDPR from an early conceptual stage to the reporting of the findings. © 2020, The Author(s).","Data protection guidelines; Ethics approval; GDPR; Research ethics; Scoping review; Serious games","Data privacy; Philosophical aspects; Exergames; General data protection regulations; Helsinki; In contexts; Research ethics; Scientific database; Scoping review; Serious games","","","","","Norges Forskningsråd, (270969); Norges Forskningsråd","Acknowledgements.

Crew and passenger training with evacuation drills is a challenging and costly process while the complexity and size of ships affect negatively the outcomes in most evacuations. A proposed solution is the development of an evacuation serious game simulator, to improve the repeatability and realism of evacuation drills. To this end, a novel prototype multiplayer serious game was developed. The Ship Evacuation Simulator (SES) allows the simultaneous participation of computer-controlled bots and human-controlled avatars in ship evacuation scenarios. In this paper, numerous sets of scenarios were conducted, with and without the participation of human users, in order to assess SES in terms of training level, evacuation time, survival rate and user immersion. The evaluation process incorporated elements such as fire, smoke, day/night rotation, etc. This paper presents the SES game and then discusses the outcomes of the evacuation sessions. Future research aims to assess the influence of virtual reality technology with SES, in order to achieve higher immersion levels. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Evacuation; Serious game; Ship evacuation simulator","Drills; E-learning; Infill drilling; Serious games; Smoke; Virtual reality; Evacuation; Evacuation drill; Evacuation time; Game simulators; Human users; Loss of life; Maritime accidents; Multiplayers; Passenger ships; Ship evacuation simulator; Ships","","","","","","","Vassalos D., Hamamoto M., Molyneux D., Papanikolaou A., Contemporary Ideas on Ship Stability, (2000); Onsongo S.K., Analysis of the Domestic Passenger Ferry Safety In, (2017); Hanninen H., Negotiated risks: The Estonia accident and the stream of bow visor failures in the Baltic ferry traffic, Helsinki School of Economics, (2007); Kee D., Jun G.T., Waterson P., Haslam R., A systemic analysis of South Korea Sewol ferry accident–Striking a balance between learning and accountability, Appl.

With Geome, the students solve ill-structured problems about environmental issues and they deal with fake news or rumors. The playful learning experience is analyzed from the players’ perspective based on the dimensions of personal epistemology, i.e. thinking and beliefs about the nature of knowledge and knowing. Experiments in the museum have been conducted with 3 classes, and mixed data (audio, video and game interactions) were collected from specific moments of the gameplay and analyzed according to the epistemological dimensions. The verbatim analysis shows that the combination of an ill-structured problem and a ludic scenario may encourage students to actively process information and to develop critical thinking. Thus, we discuss the characteristics of the game's influence on students’ personal epistemology. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Game-based learning; Mixed reality game; Museum school visits; Students’ personal epistemology","Interactive computer graphics; Mixed reality; Empirical studies; Environmental issues; Game-based Learning; Ill-structured problems; Learning experiences; Mixed data; Mixed reality game; Museum school visit; Personal epistemologies; Student’ personal epistemology; Students","","","","","","","Kiili K., Digital game-based learning: Towards an experiential gaming model, Internet High.

Since specifically developed apps would allow the assessment to be more accessible, valid, and fun for young children, “The Magic House” app was implemented. The app offers a simple game to measure updating, one of the Executive Functions. A first test was performed involving a small sample of 61–77 months old children. Results show that the internal consistency is acceptable. Non-significant differences related to gender and younger (61–70 months old) and older (71–77 months old) children were found. Furthermore, a comparison with a previous analogue version of the same task was done showing that children performance were better in the analogue version. This may also be due to the difference between actively interacting with virtual objects in a bidimensional world, from playing with real toys. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","App; Executive functions; Preschoolers; Serious games; Updating","Computers; Assessment tool; Cognitive assessments; Executive function; Internal consistency; Performance; Preschooler; Simple games; Small samples; Updating; Young children; Serious games","","","","","","","Morra S., Issues in working memory measurement: Testing for M capacity, Int.

This is a promising authoring approach that can democratize AR for learning. However, there is no systematic analysis of these emerging tools regarding what AR features and modalities they offer (RQ1). Furthermore, little is known as to how these emerging tools support teachers’ needs (RQ2). Following a two-fold approach, we first analyzed a corpus of 21 authoring tools from industry and academia and formulated a comprehensive design space with four dimensions: (1) authoring workflow, (2) AR modality, (3) AR use, and (4) content and user management. We then analyzed two workshops with 19 teachers to understand their needs for AR activities and how existing tools support them. Ultimately, we discuss how our work can support researchers and designers of educational AR authoring tools. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Augmented reality; Design process; Design space; Education","Design; Scaffolds; Authoring Approach; Authoring tool; Design spaces; Design-process; Emerging tools; Expert users; Programming skills; Systematic analysis; Teachers'; Tool support; Augmented reality","","","","","","","Akcayir M., Akcayir G., Advantages and challenges associated with augmented reality for education: A systematic review of the literature, Educ.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the barriers in home practice from the perspective of speech-language pathologists (SLP). Another goal was to gather an understanding on the role of games in speech therapy and how games could be used to overcome the above barriers. Participants were 26 SLPs in Finland who participated in an online questionnaire. Our findings indicate that successful speech therapy home practice is affected by multiple factors, such as resources, motivation and commitment, but also by multiple stakeholders. According to our results, SLPs are active users of games. The games SLPs use in their clinical work are self-made, speech therapy-targeted games (board games, digital games, functional games), commercial board games, and commercial digital games. SLPs commonly use games as platforms that they modify for different purposes. The games are used to make the speech therapy training itself playful, and playing a game is used as a reward after training. Based on our results, the supporting role of games in speech therapy is recognized by SLPs but there is still great unused potential. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Gamification; Paediatric speech therapy; Serious games; Survey","Pediatrics; Board games; Digital games; Finland; Gamification; Multiple factors; Multiple stakeholders; Online questionnaire; Pediatric speech therapy; Speech language pathologists; Speech therapy; Serious games","","","","","","","Baker E., McLeod S., Evidence-based practice for children with speech sound disorders: Part 1 narrative review, Lang Speech Hear.

A novel, rapid online workflow was developed for co-design of games for change with school teachers. Major design challenges included: short timescale; appropriately scaffolding a complex process; remote online interactions; and interdisciplinary communication. The resulting workflow is highly visual, structured, and focused on swift knowledge exchange between pedagogy and game experts, drawing on relevant frameworks. Two workshops used the new method, producing eight co-designed serious games. Analysis suggests the workflow is effective for knowledge exchange for the rapid and rigorous co-design of serious games and has advantages for inclusivity and confidence in the co-design process. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Education; Game design; Online co-design; Serious games","Design; E-learning; Game design; Knowledge management; Scaffolds; Change process; Co-designs; Design challenges; Game design; Inter-disciplinary designs; Knowledge exchange; Online co-design; School teachers; Time-scales; Work-flows; Serious games","","","","","Scottish Universities Insight Institute","The SGROC workflow provides a contribution with ongoing value to those undertaking rapid online games design with educators.

However, in the past, the realism of especially entertainment games has often been identified as insufficient. Thus, this study is investigating the degree of realism provided by the popular city builder game Cities: Skylines. To this purpose, the simulation model of Cities: Skylines is analyzed regarding the support of the domain urban water management (UWM). Thereby, different degrees of realism in UWM-related game components are revealed. All in all, there are still considerable deficits regarding the degree of realism in the CS simulation model. However, modding as a means of achieving more realistic simulation models is more widely supported than in the past. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Authenticism; Cities: Skylines; Game-based learning; Simulation game; Validity","Learning systems; Water management; Authenticism; City: skyline; Educational context; Game-based Learning; Real-world system; Serious gaming; Simulation games; Simulation model; Urban water management; Validity; Serious games","","","","","","","Abourizk S., Role of simulation in construction engineering and management, J.

The design of SGs by teachers themselves seems to be a viable solution to develop their use since they are in demand of training on the subject. However, the creation of SGs ideally involves the close collaboration of several experts: pedagogical experts (teacher), game designers, graphic designers and developers for digital SGs. However, schools rarely have the means to hire such teams and teachers find themselves leading this project alone. What advice can be given to these teachers?

However, good evaluations are necessary to improve the effectiveness of serious games, and to prove this effectiveness to stakeholders. Computer support of evaluations requires addressing several problems, including security, privacy protection, data collection from both questionnaires and in-game activities, data analysis, and management of the experimental workflow. We describe improvements to the Simva architecture to add scalability and a bridge to exploratory data science to our one-stop serious games evaluation platform. Simva supports evaluations ranging from small-scale pilots to full-fledged validations with complex experimental designs. The improvements described in this paper greatly increase ease of deployment, interoperation with existing authentication infrastructure, and scalability of Simva, and can be readily applied to tools with similar goals. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Evaluation; Learning analytics; Serious games","Computer privacy; Data Science; Privacy by design; Scalability; Surveys; Authentication infrastructure; Computer support; Data collection; Evaluation platforms; Interoperations; Privacy protection; Scalable architectures; Time-consuming tasks; Serious games","","","","","Regional Government of Madrid, (P2018/TCS4307); Telefonica-Complutense; European Commission, EC, (IMPRESS 2017-1-NL01-KA203-035259); Ministry of Education, MOE, (TIN2017-89238-R)","Acknowledgements.

Even though game-based learning has become more common in education, relatively little is known about the motivational power of leaderboards in team-based educational settings. This paper aims to contribute to this gap by exploring to what extent leaderboards motivate players in collaborative and competitive game-based learning context. The meaning of leaderboards was studied in a team-based math game competition relying on intra-classroom collaboration and inter-classroom competition. The findings suggest that the team rank, team commitment, and enjoyment of the game predicted leaderboard motivation. The results revealed that even though leaderboards were motivating in general, players whose team did not succeed well in the competition were less motivated. It seems that leaderboards may facilitated collaboration but the collaborative element of the competition did not totally reduce the negative effects of the used infinite leaderboard. These findings disclose some drawbacks of an infinite leaderboard design. To overcome this problem, we suggest some ways to redesign leaderboards for educational use. Finally, we discuss implications of the research for using leaderboards in game-based learning settings, factors affecting leaderboard motivation, and leaderboard design in general. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Collaboration; Game-based learning; Leaderboards; Mathematics; Team competition","Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Competitive games; Educational settings; Educational use; Game-based Learning; Performance based; Team commitments; Motivation","","","","","","","Ryan R.M., Rigby C.S., Motivational foundations of game-based learning, Handbook of Game-Based Learning, pp. 153-176, (2020); Sailer M., Homner L., The gamification of learning: A meta-analysis, Educ.

Such controllers are not always precise or deft enough to adequately train people through Serious Games (SG) Applications. Virtual Reality environments open up huge opportunities for training “in the round” and while efforts are being made to refine controllers for use in this 3D VR medium, we propose that there is a case to be made now for a mixed medium approach, combining the freedom (and safety) of VR training with tactile, real-world equipment, integrated into the software. While not all VR training requires this level of specialism, it is an avenue worth exploring when trainees are learning skills that could save lives, or where full precision, at speed, could mean the difference between life and death. This paper presents a preliminary study within the context of our own case study of the creation and testing of a SG, VR based training application for the correct use of fire extinguishers, and how to use them to control a fire swiftly and safety. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Extension embodiment; Mixed medium approach; Serious games; Tactile touch feedback; Virtual Reality","Controllers; Safety testing; Serious games; Virtual reality; 3D virtual reality; At-speed; Extension embodiment; Learning skills; Mixed medias; Mixed medium approach; Real-world; Tactile touch feedback; Virtual reality training; Virtual-reality environment; Feedback","","","","","","","Direktoratet for Samfunnssikkerhet Og Beredskap: Omkomne I Brann; Sturm L.P., Windsor J.A., Cosman P.H., Cregan P., Hewett P.J., Maddern G.J., A systematic review of skills transfer after surgical simulation training, Ann.

This usage increased during the pandemic, and heterogeneous motivation was found in the target audiences. Gamification is seen as enhancing the motivation of heterogeneous audiences to more homogeneous levels. Consequently, the question arises, which options are available for the gamification of spatial digital learning environments? This article presents the results of a rapid literature review addressing what is known regarding a) which mechanisms of gamification support engagement and motivation, b) which mechanisms of gamification support spatial learning, and c) why and when gamification should be used. The three databases ACM, IEEE and Scopus were examined, and 25 relevant articles were found. Qualitative results regarding the application domains, the type of digital environment, the gamification mechanisms, and the influence of gamification are compiled. Overall, the results reveal that gamification elements applied in spatial digital learning environments have so far been little adapted to spatiality. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","360-degree; Education; Spatiality; Virtual field trips; Virtual lab; Virtual reality","Computer aided instruction; E-learning; Motivation; 360-degree; Digital learning environment; Gamification; High educations; Literature reviews; Spatial dimension; Spatiality; Virtual field trips; Virtual lab; Virtual worlds; Virtual reality","","","","","Unilog, (621547-EPP-1–2020-1-RO-EPPA3-IPI-SOC-IN, CB743); European Commission, EC; Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF, (16DHB2113, 16DHB2131)","Acknowledgement.

This paper presents findings from a study to understand whether serious games can be effective in communicating concepts related to magmatic processes. We developed a serious game “Magma Pop” for use in an undergraduate geology classroom. The goal was to create an engaging experience to reinforce factual knowledge on mineral formulae and conceptual understanding of the fractional crystallization process to clarify the link between changing temperatures and magma and mineral composition. Students’ game experience was evaluated during an in-class activity followed by an online survey. We found that despite a few technical glitches, the game concept and user experience were positively rated by students. The proposed game was well received and has now been integrated as a regular component of the course. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Educational tools; Fractional crystallization; Game-based learning; Magma; Minerals; Serious games; Volcano","Geology; Serious games; Students; Cognitive development; Creative problem-solving; Critical thinking; Development Learning; Educational tools; Fractional crystallization; Game-based Learning; High educations; Magma; Social learning; Minerals","","","","","","","Video Games Market is Worth More than Music and Movies Combined So Why aren’t Csps Launching Games Services, (2022); Siemieniec R., Mente R., 600 V Power Device Technologies for Highly Efficient Power supplies,º in 2021 23Rd European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications; Plass J.L., Homer B.D., Kinzer C.K., Foundations of game-based learning, Educ.

The players first have to perform a cognitive analysis of the learning tasks of a lesson, then they are faced with disruptive events they react on, guided by theoretically-sound frameworks. We examined seven pre-service teacher students using Class-Card on five simulations. The results show that participants were engaged in rich decisions and verbal interactions about the events they were faced to.

The game is about learning basic and advanced concepts of the programming language C++. Its design was carried out using the EFM design model, while its pilot evaluation was carried out using the MEEGA evaluation model. The main goal of the game is to introduce users to the C++ programming language in a fun and serious way. In contrast with most of the existing programming SGs that are based on puzzles, this game uses an office metaphor and the player undertakes the role of a candidate programmer. The game uses techniques and mechanisms that ultimately aim to stimulate the learner’s sense of seriousness and responsibility when learning C++ and not just to entertain him/her during training. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","C++; Programming; Serious game (SG); Serious game design model; Serious game evaluation model","Ada (programming language); C++ (programming language); Design modeling; Evaluation modeling; Learning c; Serious games","","","","","","","Zyda M., From visual simulation to virtual reality to games, IEEE Computer Society, Information Sciences Institute, California, pp. 25-32, (2005); Song M., Zhang S., EFM: A model for educational game design, Edutainment 2008.

Although several suggestions have been made to design serious collaborative games, the RPGs’ social interactions have not yet been explored in the context of science learning. This study evaluated a multiplayer game that integrates chemistry content in the gameplay mechanics of adventure games and RPGs. Twelve game testers participated in the evaluation process, constructing five groups: two groups of three persons and three groups of two. The players downloaded and installed the game on their computers, and then they played it. The results from the qualitative data confirmed that the clearly defined rules system facilitated teamwork through constant coordination and communication, making playing a pleasant experience. In addition, each player progressed his/her character through individual activities, promoting active collaboration in the missions’ accomplishment. Thus, the social character of RPGs has the potential to support the design of collaborative learning settings. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Collaborative games; Role-Playing games; Science education","Game design; Human resource management; Interactive computer graphics; Adventure games; Collaborative games; Gameplay; Multiplayer games; Multiplayers; Qualitative data; Role-playing game; Science education; Science learning; Social interactions; Serious games","","","","","","","Dillenbourg P., What do you mean by collaborative learning?, Collaborative-Learning: Cognitive and Computational Approaches, pp. 1-19, (1999); Hitchens M., Drachen A., The many faces of role-playing games, Int.

The emergence of authoring tools in the last decade aimed to address this challenge, and to provide teachers means to improve the use of games in education. In spite of that, bridging games and education, especially inclusive education, is yet to reach momentum. In creating serious games, teachers are to follow the rigors of game design processes, and attempt to meet the learner expectations that are shaped by a decades-old, successful entertainment industry. In this context, the authors discuss the challenges associated with gamified and game-based authoring processes, and present the rationale behind the design of an authoring tool that aims to provide teachers with a richer inventory of assets and tools to facilitate the creation of engaging learning experiences in support of inclusive education. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Authoring tools; Game design; Inclusive education","Design; Serious games; Authoring tool; Customisation; Educational game; Game design; Inclusive education; Key Issues; Learning context; Learning experiences; Ready to use; Teachers'; Game design","","","","","","","Dag F., Durdu L., Gerdan S., Evaluation of educational authoring tools for teachers stressing of perceived usability features, Proc.

Our results demonstrate that fluid intelligence is particularly important, which is in line with previous non-game-based studies that show a relationship between classical planning tests and fluid intelligence. Video games have been previously used for research into cognitive processes and taking them online facilitates data collection on a larger scale. Online video games also afford data collection without the expense and stress of a laboratory environment. For these reasons, using online video games to investigate human cognition is a promising alternative to the classic cognitive paradigms used in laboratories. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Cognitive skills; Fluid intelligence; Numeracy; Planning capabilities; Video games","Human computer interaction; Interactive computer graphics; Statistics; Cognitive skill; Data collection; Fluid intelligence; Numeracy; Online video; Planning ability; Planning capability; Predictive factors; Subjective numeracies; Video-games; Data acquisition","","","","","Ministry of Economic Affairs and Municipality of Tilburg","Acknowledgments.

In order though for educators and game designers to use these tools to their full potential and provide pedagogical opportunities to support problem-solving activities, we should identify and characterise artifactual affordances in playful robotics. In problem-solving activities, supported by educational robotics artifacts, learners need to identify the artifactual affordances through their interaction with the artifact. This study aims to identify artifactual affordances through the analysis of 15 participants’ engagement in the CreaCube task. In this playful problem-solving activity, based on the use of modular robotics, players need to manipulate and assemble robotic cubes in order to create independently moving vehicles. This study aims at providing an initial analysis for the study of artifactual affordances in playful educational robotics. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Affordances; Educational robotics; Game based learning; Human computer interaction","End effectors; Robotics; Affordances; Educational robotics; Game designers; Learning experiences; Modular robotics; Moving vehicles; Educational robots","","","","","","","Bellotti F., Et al., Designing a course for stimulating entrepreneurship in higher education through serious games, Procedia Comput.

One of the rationales for serious gaming, i.e. using the medium of games for purposes other than entertainment, is the assumption of high motivation fostered by games. Both theoretical discourses and evidence-based meta studies question this assumption. However, together with this assumption, a central justification of high production efforts required for games would also be eliminated, since an equivalent learning effectiveness could presumably also be achieved with media produced more efficiently. Therefore, this study examines whether serious gaming achieves a higher motivation than other learning activities. For three learning activities (serious gaming, lecture and field trip) being part of a Master’s program in Environmental Engineering, the motivation is measured using the instruments SIMS (Situational Motivational Scale) and QCM (Questionnaire to Assess Current Motivation in Learning Situations). The results show an increased intrinsic motivation for serious gaming at higher perceived learning outcomes and lower perceived mental load. Thus, it appears that serious gaming can contribute to an increased motivation. Further, by discussing factors that influence the selection and application of games, the article contributes to attainment of high intrinsic motivation in serious gaming. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Extrinsic motivation; Intrinsic motivation; Learning activity; QCM; SIMS","Motivation; Evidence-based; Intrinsic motivation; Learning Activity; Learning effectiveness; Learning situation; Perceived learning outcomes; Production efforts; Serious gaming; Serious games","","","","","","","Squire K.R., Video Games and Learning: Teaching and Participatory Culture in the Digital Age, (2011); Zander S., Heidig S., Motivations design bei der Konzeption multimedialer Lernumgebungen, Handbuch Bildungstechnologie, pp. 393-415, (2020); Ryan R.M., Deci E.L., Self-Determination Theory: Basic Psychological Needs in Motivation, Development, and Wellness, (2017); Man, Play and Games, (2001); Garris R., Ahlers R., Driskell J.E., Games, motivation, and learning: A research and practice model, Simul.

Although several serious games (SG) for QC are available to date, the specific learning needs of IT professionals are not sufficiently covered to equip them with a knowledge base on the fundamental concepts of QC. Based on an analysis of 12 current SGs in QC, we have identified the concept of Entanglement as an underrepresented learning objective and have developed a SG around Quantum Entanglement using the Greenberg-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) experiment as a joint project in cooperation with the IBM Quantum Ambassadors team. This paper advances the knowledge base within the field of SGs and learning across three dimensions: (1) it identifies Quantum Entanglement as underrepresented learning topic in the array of QC concepts covered by SGs, (2) provides a case study on the development of a SG in the application domain QC for a business context, and therefore (3) fundamentally adds to the understanding how and with whom such a SG is used in the advanced professional computing industry. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Application of serious games; Entanglement; GHZ experiment; IT professionals; Quantum computing; Serious games","Knowledge acquisition; Knowledge based systems; Quantum computers; Serious games; Academic institutions; Business contexts; Computing industry; Fundamental concepts; Learning objectives; Quantum Computing; Specific learning; Three dimensions; Quantum entanglement","","","","","","","Chow J., Gambetta J., Quantum Takes Flight: Moving from Laboratory Demonstrations to Building Systems, IBM Research Blog, (2020); Mermin N.D., Quantum Computer Science: an Introduction, (2007); Woerner S., Egger D.J., Quantum risk analysis, Npj Quantum Inf, 5, (2019); Airbus Innovation: Airbus Quantum Computing Challenge; Nielsen M.A., Chuang I.L., Quantum Computation and Quantum Information, (2010); Einstein A., Born M., Briefwechsel 1916-955, (2005); Conati C., Zhao X., Building and evaluating an intelligent pedagogical agent to improve the effectiveness of an educational game, Proceedings of the 9Th International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces (IUI 2004).

As result of these sessions, 66 prototypes of digital games were produced. The toolkit was used through questionnaires applied by the end of the game design sessions. Results indicate that the Toolkit was a very useful resource in scaffolding the narrative construction process and that its resources are adequate to be used by for both upper-secondary and undergraduate students, and that it can be seen as a valuable resource to support educators and trainers in educational and serious game design activities. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Authoring tool; Digital games; Environmental awareness; Game design toolkit; Methodology; Serious games","Scaffolds; Serious games; Students; Surveys; Active agents; Authoring tool; Critical thinking skills; Digital games; Educational contents; Environmental awareness; Game design; Game design toolkit; Learning-by-doing; Methodology; Game design","","","","","Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT; Ministerstwo Edukacji i Nauki, MNiSW; Ministério da Ciência, Tecnologia e Ensino Superior, MCTES","Acknowledgments.

The FLIGBY game was developed with the intention of teaching learners to understand the concept of Flow and apply this within their leadership practice. In FLIGBY, the player assumes the role of General Manager of a winery in California and must make 150+ complex decisions while managing the winery team and strategic direction to ensure the business’s success. This allows for the assessment of players’ skill level in 29 ‘soft skills’ and provides the rare ability to quantify changes in players’ leadership abilities. Use of the game to develop soft skills is discussed, including an extensive range of feedback provided during the game. Suggestions for future research include further interrogation of the dataset collected as learners progress through the game, along with additional measurement to assess how learners achieve a state of Flow while playing the game. Investigation of the roles of storification and socially constructed realities is also recommended. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","FLIGBY; Leadership development; Serious game; Soft skills","Human resource management; Wine; California; Complex decision; Development targets; FLIGBY; Flow experience; General manager; Leadership development; Pedagogical tools; Psychological state; Soft skills; Serious games","","","","","ALEAS Simulations Inc.","No potential conflict of interest is reported by the authors.

After a summary of the story and its literary relevance we introduce our concept of the game based around audiovisual storytelling with a runner game and provide an overview about included didactic elements. We discuss our strategy on how to keep players intrinsic motivation high to achieve a longer playtime and thereby better knowledge consolidation. Finally, we present several generalized code components which arose during development. These components - such as an audiovisual cutscene and an endless runner template - provide the opportunity to develop similar serious games without requiring coding skills. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Digital humanities; Digital literary; Serious games","Knowledge management; Code components; Digital humanities; Digital literary; Fairy tales; Game-Based; Generalized codes; Intrinsic motivation; Knowledge transfer; Traditional knowledge; Transfer method; Serious games","","","","","","","Jones S.E., New media and modeling: Games and the digital humanities, A New Companion to Digital Humanities, (2015); Hergenrader T., The place of videogames in the digital humanities, On Horiz, 24, 1, pp. 29-33; Rabenstein S., Ludwig Tiecks Der blonde Eckbert: Eine individualpsychologisch-analytische Deutung des “Wahnsinnsmärchens”, Zeitschrift für Freie Psycho-Analytische Forschung Und Individualpsychologie, (2016); Blair L., The cake is not a lie: How to design effective achievements, Gamasutra-The Art Business of Making Games","K.

However, existing instructional design models are limited in use when it comes to how to implement and integrate SGs within the existing curricula. Furthermore, the trainer perspective is often neglected in literature about serious games. The aim of this study was to explore the experiences of both students and trainers after the implementation and use of a SG in a master level course in project management (PM). Data was collected using six focus group interviews (FGIs) comprising 38 students. In addition, trainers’ experiences were gathered as written comments to the results from the FGIs. Data was analysed using inductive content analysis. Results identified several issues related to the implementation and use of the SG that can be summarized through the following main- and subthemes; 1) Integration (introduction, facilitation, feedback and debriefing) and 2) Usability and gameplay (user interface design, learnability and use, immersion and satisfaction). Results showed that when adopting an existing SG to a course it enhances the need for a good implementation process, especially when it comes to provision of information, instructions, and feedback from trainers. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to share some of the experiences, issues and important lessons learned from the implementation to inform trainers on what to focus on when considering implementing SGs in their program. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Implementation; Integration; Serious games; Simulation","Education computing; Human computer interaction; Project management; Students; User interfaces; Active Learning; Content analysis; Educational institutions; Higher education; Implementation process; Instructional design model; Related works; User interface designs; Serious games","","","","","","","Abt C.C., Serious Games, (1987); Loh C.S., Sheng Y., Ifenthaler D., Serious games analytics: Theoretical framework, Serious Games Analytics.

Traditional user input devices can break immersion and may not be suitable for developing psychomotor skills due to the differences with real medical equipment. In this paper, we present the development of a stethoscope replica for cardiac auscultation training and focus on understanding the usability effects on diagnosis practices employing a virtual reality controller, touch gestures, and the proposed makerspace replica, when compared to a simulation manikin. Our preliminary results from four examination scenarios shows that immersive and non-immersive VR are found more usable than a simulation manikin, thus showing an opportunity to further engage learners with interactive learning experiences. Additionally, based on the auscultation examination, it was clear that the participant pool had a diverse range of cardiac auscultation skills, with several failing at diagnosing the murmurs, thus highlighting the importance of our proposed approach. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Cardiac auscultation; Immersive technologies; Simulation; Virtual reality","Diagnosis; E-learning; User experience; Consumables; Diverse range; Immersive; Immersive VR; Interactive learning; Learning experiences; User input; Virtual reality","","","","","Universidad Militar Nueva Granada, UMNG, (INV-ING-2363/2017)","Acknowledgements.

Games might be able to help to address this rather new field of education. Therefore, we first conducted a literature analysis on the use of games that aim at supporting critical reading and media literacy. We found that most of the used games improved participants’ critical reading skills, were mostly targeted at adults, and the games focused on written information and fake news, but omitted graph literacy. Next, we ran an empirical study to investigate adolescents’ competencies in critically reading and interpreting graphs. In a storified setting, adolescents acted as fact checkers and were supposed to interpret graphs and identify misleading graphs. Our results revealed that adolescents struggled in both the identification of misleading graphs as well as the interpretation of graphs. Consequently, based on our literature review and empirical results, we developed a game to support graph reading. The design of the game is presented. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Critical reading; Game-based learning; Graph literacy; Misleading graphs","Computers; Critical reading; Game-based Learning; Graph literacy; Information society; Literature analysis; Misleading graph; Multisteps; Reading skills; Research approach; Written information; Graphic methods","","","","","Strategic Research Council, RSF","This research is funded by the Strategic Research Council (SRC).","Kendeou P., Robinson D.H., McCrudden M., Misinformation and Fake News in Education, (2019); Bursztyn L., Rao A., Roth C., Yanagizawa-Drott D., Misinformation during a Pandemic, (2020); Kiili C., Leu D.J., Marttunen M., Hautala J., Leppanen P.H.T., Exploring early adolescents’ evaluation of academic and commercial online resources related to health, Read.

Fuel channel assembly enables the heat transfer from the nuclear fuel to heavy water coolant. Heavy water coolant under elevated pressure (∼ 10 MPa), carries the heat generated from nuclear fission reaction to heat exchangers located outside the reactor core to generate steam that will turn the turbine to generate electricity. The fuel channel assembly also allows the fueling machine to perform online refueling of nuclear fuel and provide shielding protection to safeguard the nuclear workers while providing structural integrity during the regular operation of the nuclear reactor. The physical configuration and coolant flow path of the CANDU fuel channel assembly is very complex, and teaching and training associated with the fuel channel assembly employ pictures and computer simulations. However, these traditional approaches lack the immersion and interactivity that virtual reality can provide to realistically expose learners in a safe and controlled manner otherwise difficult to achieve in real life due to the dangers of radiation exposure. In this paper, we present the development of virtual reality (VR) fuel assembly prototype generated for teaching CANDU concepts. Our preliminary study focused on understanding face validity and usability perceptions regarding the virtual interactions. Preliminary feedback from content exports provided us with valuable insights on improvements regarding usability, fidelity, and gamification. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Calandria; CANDU; Educational; Fuel channel; Nuclear Science; Reactor core; Virtual reality","Coolants; E-learning; Heat exchangers; Heat transfer; Heavy water; Heavy water reactors; Nuclear fuels; Reactor cores; Virtual reality; Water cooling systems; Elevated pressure; Generate electricity; Heavy water coolants; Radiation Exposure; Regular operations; Traditional approaches; Virtual interactions; Virtual reality technology; Reactor shielding","","","","","Sigma Lab; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC, (RGPIN-2018-05917)","Funding text 1: The financial support of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) in the form of a Discovery Grant RGPIN-2018-05917 awarded to Alvaro Uribe Quevedo, supporting Kody Wood and Ziqi Fan’s research.

These environments are typically supported by immersive technologies to improve immersion and provide real-time feedback. However, designing an ILS is a strenuous process due to its wide selection of technologies, design practices, and pedagogical interventions. In this paper, we evaluate the unified taxonomy of ILS by conducting a qualitative analysis with 42 experts from various backgrounds.

This article deals with the design of a digital companion to help a game master to orchestrate a game. This companion is integrated in a game, Geome, a mixed-reality game dedicated to museum school visits, that combines tangible and digital elements. This companion is based on the collection of multimodal traces from different interactions set up during the whole game scenario. This paper addresses the issue of the traces to collect to help the game master in the configuration and the monitoring of the activity. The presented prototype is the result of a co-design process between researchers, practitioners, and computer scientists. Thus, we present the first results from 3 experiments conducted with students (12–15 years old) in a natural museum. The results show the types of interactions tracked during the game use and the needed information for the game orchestration. However, while the players play the game as intended using most of the features, the game master makes little use of his dashboard and does not interact with the players through the dedicated interface. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Game-master; Mixed-reality game; Orchestration","Co-designs; Digital elements; Digital games; Game elements; Game masters; Game scenario; Mixed reality game; Multi-modal; Orchestration; Precise monitoring; Mixed reality","","","","","","","Cheok A., Et al., Touch-Space: Mixed-Reality Game Space Based on Ubiquitous, Tangible, and Social Computing, Personal Ub Comp, 6, pp. 430-442, (2002); Tychsen A., Tales for the Many: Process and Authorial Control in Multi-player Role-Playing Games, ICIDS 2008.

Puzzle-based micro-games may be an advantageous method for quickly learning declarative knowledge, i.e. knowledge pertaining to facts and definitions. In military exercises and wargames, there is a need to quickly absorb declarative knowledge pertaining to a hypothetical scenario before beginning the exercise. In this work, an application of the micro-game concept within a military context, the Organizational Chart Puzzle (OCP) for learning a Command and Control (C2) structure, and results of usability testing are presented. The OCP was well-liked and easily learned by usability testing participants. Additionally, participants were asked to recreate the C2 structure from memory after playing the OCP and showed high knowledge transfer from the game to the paper test, suggesting this concept may be a viable path for quick learning of declarative knowledge. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Military training; Serious games; Usability testing","Command and control systems; Knowledge management; Learning systems; Military applications; Personnel training; Usability engineering; Well testing; Application testing; Corporate trainings; Declarative knowledge; Education training; Knowledge pertaining; Military exercise; Military healthcare; Military training; Organisational; Usability testing; Serious games","","","","","","","Smith R., The long history of gaming in military training, Simul.

Students are not always well prepared for such a work mode and struggle with time and energy management, leading to stress and long unhealthy study sessions. There are many applications aimed at developing productivity habits. A few of them are somewhat gamified, although they are especially focused on real-world to-do lists, lacking a strong narrative and appeal, especially to students. We present the serious game BusyBusy, specifically designed for college students. The game revolves around the capture and reflection steps of David Allen’s Getting Things Done methodology. By simulating aspects of student life, BusyBusy facilitates students to practice capturing action-related thoughts in their real life and reflect upon study activity choices in an entertaining and engaging environment. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Getting Things Done; Habit building; Mobile games; Personal productivity; Serious games","Productivity; Students; College students; Knowledge work; Real-world; Work mode; Serious games","","","","","","","Allen D., Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity, (2001); Bada S.O., Olusegun S., Constructivism learning theory: A paradigm for teaching and learning, J.

The current UK defence procurement process seeks design ideas from a small community of experts through synchronous meetings, attendance at human factors laboratories, and subjective assessment at the manufacturer’s location. These traditional design methods, while termed ‘user-centred’, assume that the expert users are able to travel and meet, which was difficult to achieve even pre-covid pandemic. The use of Serious Games in the defence design context and the crowdsourced objective testing of the design options is novel and untried. This research offers a route for incremental asynchronous design and test activities. Using a crowdsourcing construct, designers, expert and less-skilled users share views and prototype human-computer interface design ideas as part of a Serious Game hosted in a web browser. This research is a worked example of how a Serious Game can support remote design with this paper reporting on crowdsourced objective testing of human-computer interfaces for defence and security equipment. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Crowdsourcing; Human factors; Innovation","Crowdsourcing; Data visualization; Design; Game design; Human computer interaction; 'current; Defense procurement; Design ideas; Design innovations; Human computer interfaces; Innovation; Laboratory assessment; Procurement process; Security organizations; Small community; Serious games","","","","","","","Oates E.P., Learning and designing with serious games: Crowdsourcing for procurement.

Many new didactic opportunities, but also major technological, social and methodological challenges, emerged. In the phase of exclusively online teaching in 2020, it became quickly evident that the sole transfer from analog to digital teaching was not effective: New designs for motivational learning scenarios were called for. This articles discusses art- and design-based experiments and methods in higher education learning scenarios, where a ludic sophistication of digital didactics was further developed. “Ludic didactics” encompass playful, game-based approaches, methods and settings that support and inspire teachers and learners in education. Thus, ludic didactics are understood more as a form of “playification” than “gamification”: Their playful mechanics and methods go beyond the still prevailing use of points, badges and leaderboards which are applied for learning incentives and feedback. In this paper we give examples and propose PHEW (Play/Hybrid/Easy/Walkabout), a set of “superpower” methods for ludic didactics. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Digital didactics; Education; Gamification; Ludic didactics; Playification; Serious games","Computer aided instruction; E-learning; Learning systems; Analog-to-digital; Digital didactic; Digital space; Gamification; Learning environments; Learning scenarios; Ludic didactic; Online teaching; Playification; Rapid transformations; Serious games","","","","","","","Siemieniec R., Mente R., 600 V Power Device Technologies for Highly Efficient Power supplies,º in 2021 23Rd European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications; Siemieniec R., Mente R., 600 V Power Device Technologies for Highly Efficient Power supplies,º in 2021 23Rd European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications; Richard B., The Bartle Test of Gamer Psycholog, (2000); Siemieniec R., Mente R., 600 V Power Device Technologies for Highly Efficient Power supplies,º in 2021 23Rd European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications; Siemieniec R., Mente R., 600 V Power Device Technologies for Highly Efficient Power supplies,º in 2021 23Rd European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications; Siemieniec R., Mente R., 600 V Power Device Technologies for Highly Efficient Power supplies,º in 2021 23Rd European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications; de Luca V., Rossini-Drecq E., Ascolese A., Turning fun into learning: How serious games inspire new educational frameworks, IATED Academy.

In the field of Serious Games (SGs), metaphors connect the user’s previous experience in the game domain to the information load that is intended to be conveyed. This paper presents a prototype of a model for the design of SGs based on the extensive use of the concept of metaphor. As a case study, the design of the digital SG BubbleMumble is introduced. BubbleMumble is intended to convey the fundamental concepts behind the extracellular vesicle biogenesis and production processes exploiting metaphor-driven SG design. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Extracellular vesicles; Metaphors; Serious game design","Artificial intelligence; Computers; Game design; Abstract concept; Case-studies; Cognitive tool; Extracellular; Extracellular vesicle; Fundamental concepts; Game-Based; Metaphor; Serious games designs; Vesicle biogenesis; Serious games","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (801338); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020","Acknowledgements.

Due to the pivotal role of Middle Managers (MM) in business strategy, this study investigates their perspective on the organizational, individual, and gamification-related factors that may influence the adoption of gamification as a strategic alignment tool. Four focus groups with MM revealed the most relevant antecedents for participants. The paper offers companies some suggestions on how to design and implement successful gamified experiences. Namely, it suggests that clear support of top managers and the involvement of MM in the adoption of gamification may avoid MM’ resistance and enhance their motivation and engagement in the process. Also, to assure an effective contribution of MM, it is advisable to evaluate their gamification competences and provide them with adequate training when needed. Finally, due their pivotal position, MM can offer valuable insights to design and communicate the gamification modalities that are the most adequate to participants, thus reducing the identified risks and fostering success. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Gamification; Middle managers; Strategic alignment","Alignment; Managers; Personnel training; Business strategy; Design and implements; Exploratory studies; Middle managers; Motivation and engagements; Related factors; Strategic alignment; Strategy alignment; Gamification","","","","","","","Robson K., Et al., Is it all a game?

Today they represent one of the biggest sectors in the entertainment industry and their market share continues to increase. Archaeological content has been often used as a triggering subject but archaeologically inspired interactive entertainment titles are often an outlet for some of the worst kinds of pseudo-archaeological ideas (e.g. Tomb Raider series). Given the significant numbers of the video gaming industry, an evident fascination with the past by designers and consumers of games, and a marked risk of archaeology misconception, I suggest archaeologists should engage more with this medium and especially in SGs becoming the domain experts who select the educational contents and provide scientific validity and reliability. The paper focuses on the Italian experience in the last years where archaeological SGs are finally getting more academic recognition and underlines the positive effects of this approach in terms of educational goals for both kids and adults, widespread accurate knowledge for a wider and more diversified public, and eventually touristic outcomes. These are all aspects that the most recent and significant European conventions and documents concerning cultural heritage sustainable development stressed. Archaeological sites and museums can be greatly benefited by the use of SGs as much as archaeologists: as active agents in this process, they can inject a measure of ethical archaeology in the game industry and reach groups of people that, traditionally, have been relatively untouched by previous public education and outreach. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Archaeology; Heritage enhancement; Serious games","Competition; Entertainment; Historic preservation; Human computer interaction; Learning systems; Archaeological site; Cultural heritages; Domain experts; Educational contents; Educational goals; Game industry; Interactive entertainment; Public education; Serious games","","","","","","","Dati Sul Mercato E Sui Consumatori, (2020); Mol A.A., Ariese-Vandemeulebroucke C.E., Boom K.H.J., Politopoulos A., The Interactive Past: Archaeology, Heritage, and Video Games, (2017); Reinhard A., Archaeogaming: An Introduction to Archaeology in and of Video Games, (2018); Hageneuer S., Communicating the past in the Digital Age Proceedings of the International Conference on Digital Methods in Teaching and Learning in Archaeology (12–13 October 2018), (2020); Watral E., Digital pharaoh: Archaeology, public education, and interactive entertainment, Public Archaeol, 2, 3, pp. 163-169, (2002); Mariotti S., Serious games and Archaeology: Rough Notes on Crafting Archaeological Data for Heritage Enhancement, Advances in Interdisciplinary Cultural Heritage Studies; Shapiro J., The New Childhood: Raising Kids to Thrive in a Connected World, (2018); Mortara M., Catalano C.E., Bellotti F., Fiucci G., Houry-Panchetti M., Petridis P., Learning cultural heritage by SGs, J.

This paper uses the extended ludo narrative variable model (eLNVM) and its categories as identification criteria to uniquely classify serious games by their narrative structure. To investigate differences in self-reported effects on engagement, motivation, and learning, a dataset of 15 serious games has been classified. The results show differences in effectiveness with the non-linear narrative serious games evaluating better than the linear ones across the three effect types.

The objectives were to increase leisure reading engagement among young Danish adults and to familiarize the group with original version as a supplement to the Disney version. The novelty within this study is the focus on leisure reading engagement and having participants read a story in its original 1837 language. 25 participants were included in a formative evaluation. The evaluation was based on three questionnaires at various stages of the game play, and six participants were selected for in-depth interviews. The findings reveal increased engagement and interest in the story throughout the game. There was a very high level of interest in the story and some good indicators that the users read the entire story. In conclusion, when designing a serious game to promote increased leisure reading engagement, intrinsic motivation is of high importance. Telling the original story of The Little Mermaid in a serious game is, to a large extent, about transforming the fairy tale into a digital storytelling with meaningful skills and knowledge for the users. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Digital storytelling; Formative evaluation; Intrinsic motivation; Reading engagement","Leisure; Surveys; Digital storytelling; Fairy tales; Formative evaluation; Game plays; In-depth interviews; Intrinsic motivation; Level Of Interest; Young adults; Serious games","","","","","","","The Little Mermaid: Walt Disney Feature Animation and Walt Disney Pictures, (1989); Baron N.S., Words Onscreen: The Fate of Reading in an Online World, (2015); Reading Still Matters: What the Research Reveals about Reading, Libraries, and Community, (2018); Twenge J.M., Martin G.N., Spitzberg B.H., Trends in US Adolescents’ media use, 1976– 2016: The rise of digital media, the decline of TV, and the (near) demise of print, Psychol.

However, the capabilities of fNIRS are still underutilized. FNIRS is less prone to motion artifacts and more portable in comparison to other neuroimaging methods and it is therefore ideal for experimental designs which involve physical activity. In this paper, the goal is to demonstrate the feasibility of fNIRS for the recording of cortical activation during a motion-intensive task, namely basketball dribbling. FNIRS recordings over sensorimotor regions were conducted in a block-design on 20 participants, who dribbled a basketball with their dominant right hand. Signal quality for task-related concentration changes in oxy-Hb and deoxy-Hb has been investigated by means of the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). A statistical comparison of average CNR from the fNIRS signal revealed the expected effect of significantly higher CNR over the left as compared to the right sensorimotor region. Our findings demonstrate that fNIRS delivers sufficient signal quality to measure hemispheric activation differences during a motion-intensive motoric task like basketball dribbling and bare indications for future endeavors with fNIRS in less constraint settings. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Basketball; CNR; Contrast-to-noise ratio; fNIRS; Functional near-infrared spectroscopy; Gaming; Motor activity; Sensorimotor cortex; Serious games","Functional neuroimaging; Infrared devices; Near infrared spectroscopy; Serious games; Sports; Contrast-to-noise ratio; Functional near infrared spectroscopy; Gaming; Motor activity; Neuroimaging techniques; Sensorimotor cortex; Sensorimotors; Signal quality; Chemical activation","","","","","","","Kober S.E., Wood G., Kiili K., Moeller K., Ninaus M., Game-based learning environments affect frontal brain activity, Plos One, 15, (2020); Wang Z., Et al., Effects of three different rehabilitation games’ interaction on brain activation using functional near-infrared spectroscopy, Physiol.

People with OCD feels stuck in a stressful cycle of obsessions and compulsions. There are two approaches to diagnosing and assessing people with OCD. The first one is conducted in the doctor’s office. The second one is conducted inside a special-purpose room that is typically setup in the hospital. This second environment is constructed using virtual and augmented reality. Both approaches are challenging with difficulties such as the high cost and stigma of therapy. Fortunately, there is a third approach that uses specialized computer games to achieve the same goals. This third approach has not been researched yet in the context of OCD detection and measurement. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a serious game that can provoke OCD and then measure the intensity of the resulting obsessions and compulsions. This new game is based on the concept of cognitive gameplay. As such, the interaction between the proposed game design elements leads to the emergence of different cognitive processes, such as attention, memory, and planning, which are essential in the study of OCD. The proposed game design elements have been reviewed and approved by two psychiatrists. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Attention; Cognitive gameplay; Cognitive processes; Digital psychiatry; Game design elements; Memory; Obsessive compulsive disorder; Planning; Serious games","Augmented reality; Cognitive systems; Design; Game design; Attention; Cognitive gameplay; Cognitive process; Design elements; Digital psychiatry; Game design; Game design element; Gameplay; Measurements of; Obsessive-compulsive disorders; Serious games","","","","","Department of Psychiatry at King Saud university; King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, KFUPM","Ameera Alajlan would like to acknowledge the support received from KFUPM via the summer research program for high school students (Hxplore 2021).

A broader goal is to lay the groundwork for a better understanding of how university teachers gaming habits and preferences might be leveraged in efforts to introduce gamification in Higher Education (HE). Building on previous research, ﻿showing no differences in teachers’ attitudes towards gamification by age, gender or type of institution (public or private), ﻿this ﻿exploratory study tries to assess whether teachers’ level of familiarity with games may have an influence on their attitudes and their expectations about the use of a gamified approach in a Higher Education course. The data were collected through focus groups, involving 13 teachers all in-service in a private Italian university, and were analysed through qualitative content analysis. ﻿Participants were divided into three groups according to their playing habits and preferences (well-rounded gamers, casual gamers and non-gamers). Results show that, even though the participants’ overall attitude towards gamification was favourable, there were some differences between the three groups. For instance, teachers in the “well-rounded gamers” group expressed the highest level of concern about the possible negative effects of the use of gamification in HE, while “casual gamers” and “non-gamers” seemed to be less cautious and more focused on the possible advantages of a gamified educational strategy. “Non-gamers” were the group more concerned about the time and guidance needed to really be able to use this new pedagogical approach in their courses. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Gamer types; Gamification; Teachers’ attitudes; ﻿Higher education","Curricula; Teaching; Education course; Education teachers; Exploratory studies; Gamer type; Gamification; High educations; Teachers'; Teacher’ attitude; University teachers; ﻿high education; Air navigation","","","","","","","Schnitzler K., Holzberger D., Seidel T., All better than being disengaged: Student engagement patterns and their relations to academic self-concept and achievement, Eur.

The complexity of handling game and learning requirements leads to the lack of guidance for systematically developing cooperative serious games (SGs). To overcome the challenges, we propose a systematic approach to utilize elements of entertainment cooperative games to foster player engagement in SGs. The guideline, which consists of steps to transform the existing cooperative entertainment games into cooperative SGs, is proposed. To demonstrate the guideline application, we developed a game prototype follow the steps. To validate our guidelines, we conducted a user study to verify games for their learning potential. Learning objectives related to urban logistics are defined and limited the scope of our research. We ask participants to do pretest and posttest to measure their memorization. The study showed that the game developed followed by our method could support players to achieve learning objectives. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Cooperative games; Cooperative serious games; Game premise; Serious games development","Software prototyping; Cooperative game; Cooperative serious game; Game premise; Game prototypes; Learning goals; Learning objectives; Learning potential; Serious game development; Urban logistics; User study; Serious games","","","","","Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF, (16DHB2113); Chiang Mai University, CMU","Acknowledgement.

Therefore, playing MMORPGs requires the users to possess different social skills, build communities, and coordinate to face the challenges ahead. Recent literature suggests that these video games further help the learning process of a second language and can be used as a tool to develop practical skills. This article argues that given the complex structure of MMORPGs, users who play these video games develop new social skills, improve their previous and learn new ones applicable in real life. To understand if MMORPGs enhance social skills and produce real-life benefits like serious games, the research has been conducted with a netnography approach in (N = 1) MMORPGs and (N = 400) users involved in (PVE) and (PVP) activities. The findings illustrate that most users, from the early playtime stage of the game to the late one, have improved their social skills and, in some cases, learned new ones. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Mixed-Methods; MMORPG; Netnography; Serious games; Social Skills; Video Games","Human computer interaction; Interactive computer graphics; Social networking (online); Complex environments; Complexes structure; Learning process; Massively multiplayer online role-playing games; Mixed method; Netnography; Practical skill; Second language; Social skills; Video-games; Serious games","","","","","","","Zhang Y., Song H., Liu X., Tang D., Chen Y., Zhang X., Language learning enhanced by massive multiple online role-playing games (MMORPGs) and the underlying behavioral and neural mechanisms, Front.

Participants’ facial expressions and emotions were captured using Affdex SDK from Affectiva. The captured data were used for binomial logistic regression to predict the cognitive-affective states of flow, frustration, and boredom. The binomial logistic regression uncovered that expressions and emotions could be used to predict these cognitive-affective states of a player.

The efforts towards effective environmental education include the use of simulations that aim to bring human players closer to the natural world. In the specific case of swarm simulators, they are often constructed in a two-dimensional space and experienced from a third-person perspective, lacking the immersive benefits of seeing a game world through the character’s eyes. In this study, we developed schooling and flocking simulators to examine whether playing the simulators can affect people’s understanding of swarming behavior and feeling of connectedness to nature, made quantifiable through pre- and post-simulator questionnaires. Experiencing the simulations in first-person perspective was found to increase feelings of kinship with animals, raising connectedness to nature. Additionally, a positive correlation was observed between people’s engagement in the simulation and the increase of connectedness to nature. These findings could be useful insights in designing serious games for raising awareness or behavioral change related to environmental education. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Connectedness to nature; Environmental education; First-person perspective; Simulation games; Swarming behavior","Connectedness to nature; Environmental education; Environmental knowledge; First-person perspectives; Human players; Natural world; Pro-environmental behaviors; Simulation games; Swarming behaviours; Two dimensional spaces; Serious games","","","","","","","Barbas T.A., Paraskevopoulos S., Stamou A.G., The effect of nature documentaries on students’ environmental sensitivity: A case study, Learn.

VR is considered to be more motivating and to increase NF training success. However, hard evidence on user experience in set-ups combining VR-EEG NF has been scarcely reported. Hence, we evaluated user experience on cybersickness, discomfort/pain, technology acceptance and motivational factors and compared them between a 3D and a 2D VR scenario. Additionally, we focused on possible sex differences. 68 subjects received one VR-neurofeedback session with either a 3D or 2D VR paradigm. Statistical analyses showed that sickness was higher after the VR-NF training than before, and women experienced higher sickness values than men. Further, women reported more subjective pressure sensations on the head, eye burning and headache, as well as higher technology anxiety, less perceived usefulness of the used technology and less perceived technology accessibility. No dimensionality or sex differences regarding subjective feeling of flow and presence were found. Moreover, no differences between the 3D and 2D VR scenarios were observed. Our results indicate sex differences in user experience in VR-based NF paradigms, which should be considered when using VR as feedback modality in future NF applications. In contrast, 3D or 2D presentation of the VR scenario did not affect user experience, indicating that more immersive 3D VR scenarios do not cause more negative side effects than the less immersive 2D VR scenario. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","EEG; Neurofeedback; Virtual reality","Brain computer interface; Diseases; Visual communication; 3D virtual reality; Brain-computer interface applications; Cybersickness; Immersive; Neurofeedback; Set-ups; Sex difference; Technology acceptance; Users' experiences; Visual feedback; Virtual reality","","","","","","","Pesudovs K., The development of a symptom questionnaire for assessing virtual reality viewing using a head-mounted display, Optom.

Especially for health and safety training programmes, VR can be very useful to train people in dangerous environments and situations without imposing real danger on them or others. Chemical laboratories are environments where risks of severe injury or even fatality are always present. For this, we developed a VR serious game, called VR LaboSafe Game, as a tool for laboratory safety training. However, designing a VR serious game is a challenging task. There are many factors to consider for an optimal game design. In this study, we discuss important design considerations and we present the game design of VR LaboSafe Game. Preliminary tests of an early version of the game show usability issues and minor discomforting symptoms for some participants. Nevertheless, participants do agree that VR LaboSafe Game is useful for learning laboratory safety; is more active and responsive in their learning process and makes safety training more engaging. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Game design; Laboratory safety; Serious games; Virtual reality","Game design; Laboratories; Virtual reality; Design and Development; Game design; Gaming consoles; Health and safety; Health trainings; Laboratory safety; Safety training; Safety training program; Training tools; Virtual reality technology; Serious games","","","","","European Union’s EU Frame-work Programme for Research and Innovation Horizon 2020; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (812716); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020","Acknowledgements.

Recently, the concept receives increasing acknowledgement as a tool for achieving motivational or behavioural goals. The effects of gamification in education, on an individual level, have been the topic of academic research for some time. However, until now, only few academic studies have addressed the implementation of gamification in teams in organizational contexts. Using Q methodology, this study combines quantitative and qualitative data to explore how team members experience gamification in work teams. The results show two main perspectives on gamification in organizational work teams. The first perspective, described as the eager team gamer, is predominantly positive. It reveals an experience of increased enjoyment, collaboration, creativity, and productiveness among team members. The second perspective, labelled as the critical player, is much more demanding. It acknowledges the potential positive influences of gamification in certain contexts, but feels strongly about possible inappropriateness in serious tasks or environments, and is adverse towards competitive elements. The results of this Q study add to our understanding of how and why team members in organizations may variously perceive gamification of team tasks. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Gamification; Q methodology; Teams","Academic research; Game elements; Gamification; Individual levels; Organizational context; Q methodology; Quantitative data; Team; Team members; Work team","","","","","","","Koivisto J., Hamari J., The rise of motivational information systems: A review of gamification research, Int.

In formal education, soft skills are still underrepresented as learning objectives. To strengthen soft skills in higher education, we developed a course for undergraduate students in civil engineering. The course works with generic tasks provided by the commercial massively multiplayer online game EVE Online. The overarching research question is, to what extent the course actually trains soft skills. After first promising pilot evaluations, 22 autoethnographic essays, which the participants completed as a final assignment at the end of the course, are subject to a qualitative analysis in this study. In particular, aspects of learning, motivation, and didactic design are examined. The results confirm the findings of the pilot evaluations, in particular the development of soft skills was confirmed by the participants. Regarding motivation, it was surprising that the essays argued less with fun than with benefits for later professional life. In the context of didactic design, the suitability of the game EVE Online was questioned due to its great complexity. Also critical for the success of the course is the lack of confidence of the participants as well as their social environment in the learning effectiveness of games. Overall, this study thus provides guidance for the further development of the course including additional evaluations, which could make the course a broadly deployable learning scenario for soft skills training. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","21<sup>st</sup> century skills; EVE online; Learning; Meta skills; Qualitative analysis","Curricula; Distributed computer systems; E-learning; Interactive computer graphics; Social networking (online); Students; Teaching; 21st century skill; Communication and collaborations; EVE online; Formal education; Learning; Meta skill; Multiplayer online games; Professional life; Qualitative analysis; Soft skills; Motivation","","","","","Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF, (FKZ 16DHB2204)","Acknowledgements.

In order to determine behavioral patterns, users have been tested for system use, for participation at events and competitions, and for having tendency in social interactions. Our results reveal that we were able to distinguish engaged and non-engaged users. The Non-Engaged users were characterized as a group who were initially eager to use the application; however, this enthusiasm disappeared quickly. The study classified three typologies of engaged users. The Achievers who are motivated by the reward of achieving long-term goals, the Socializers who enjoy interacting with others and Seekers who enjoy exploring things and discovering new situations. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Motivational information system; Personalized gamification; User behavior pattern","Gamification; Behavioral patterns; Data-driven approach; Long-term goals; Social interactions; Sport activities; Usage patterns; User behavior patterns; User engagement; Behavioral research","","","","","","","Barna B., Fodor S., Gamification’s impact on employee engagement: Enhancing employee well-being with a cloud based gamified team-building application, 2018 6Th International Conference on Future Internet of Things and Cloud Workshops (Ficloudw).

This paper presents a differentiated teaching proposal based on the use of the playful activity ‘3D Heroes Introduce Themselves’ (3D HIT). It is based on the projection of 3d models on mobile devices as augmented spreads on images included in a worksheet. Together with the manipulation of 3d models, students are invited to create digital stories with relevant information. Thus, a final video is created in which heroes and mythical figures from the History subject introduce themselves with the voice of the pupils. The contribution of the activity to the students’ performance and the level of engagement and participation was examined in this study. Also, whether the production of digital narratives in combination with the manipulation of 3d models reinforced the expressiveness of pupils was examined.

Since this process is both non-renewable and polluting, finding other options is important. A clean and underutilized alternative is geothermal energy. However, it is often not considered due to sheer ignorance or misconceptions. HotPipe is a serious game designed to alleviate these problems, particularly among youth populations. Players control a drill to create geothermal wells solving a variety of puzzles, which introduce relevant cases for geothermal heating and show what geothermal wells are made of. The game focuses primarily on conveying the concepts of water circulation, relation between temperature and depth, androck type proprieties.

In the evaluation phase, students acted as assessors with the assignment of looking at the key factors contributing to engage in reading, to enhance curiosity and to raise awareness of EU GDPR concepts.

However, each MOOC platform offers different features and technical interfaces. Also, each platform collects different sets of data about user interaction, learning progress, or completion and success rates. This is an obstacle to the theoretically sound application of gamification in a vendor independent way and to the evaluation of the impact of gamification.

Elderly people are especially vulnerable to these tricks, that typically occur at the front door, street or on the phone. We have developed a virtual training environment to teach people how to handle these situations and learn them to increase their verbal resilience. The training is implemented as a tablet application and consists of six scenarios that are likely to occur in daily life. Participants are placed in a dialogue with a virtual character and may interact by choosing an answer from a fixed multiple-choice menu or by speaking the answer aloud. A speech recognition module is able to detect the level of assertiveness and provides immediate feedback to the user’s performance. In this paper, we present the implementation of the virtual training application. To evaluate the prototype a focus group was organized, consisting of potential end users. The outcomes were mainly positive and the provided feedback will be incorporated into the final version. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Learning; Serious gaming; User study","E-learning; Speech recognition; Immediate feedbacks; Learning; Personal information; Serious gaming; Speech recognition modules; Tablet applications; User study; Virtual training environments; Serious games","","","","","","","Bosse T., Gerritsen C., Towards serious gaming for communication training-a pilot study with police academy students, INTETAIN 2016 2016.

The application of INs in healthcare has already shown promising results as opposed to traditional narratives. Yet, very little is known about the effect of each specific aspect of an IN or how to create an effective IN. Using the recent IN-model of Green and Jenkins, this paper explores the applicability of its constructs and exemplifies it through a case study. In doing so, this paper looks at the challenges one runs into when designing an IN. Subsequently it presents the way in which these problems were tackled for the case study. This results in new ways to look at the practical implications of Green and Jenkin’s model, thus helping future IN designers and researchers to identify and avoid design pitfalls early. As gaps in the literature are discovered throughout the paper, possible future research topics are discussed. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Behavior change; Healthcare; Interactive narrative; Persuasion","Health care; Behavior change; Behaviour changes; Design decisions; Interactive narrative; Persuasion; Possible futures; Research topics; S models; Behavioral research","","","","","","","Green M., Jenkins K., Interactive narratives: Processes and outcomes in user-directed stories, J.

Although stealth assessment has been proven to be valid and reliable, its application is complex, laborious, and time-consuming. A generic stealth assessment tool (GSAT), proven for its robustness with simulation data, has been proposed to resolve these issues. In this study, GSAT’s robustness is further investigated by using real-world data collected from a serious game on personality traits and validated with an associated personality questionnaire (NEO PI-R). To achieve this, (a) a stepwise regression approach was followed for generating statistical models from logged data for the big five personality traits (OCEAN model), (b) the statistical models are then used with GSAT to produce inferences regarding learners’ mastery level on these personality traits, and (c) the validity of GSAT’s outcomes are examined through a correlation analysis using the results of the NEO PI-R questionnaire. Despite the small dataset GSAT was capable of making inferences on players’ personality traits. This study has demonstrated the practicable feasibility of the SA methodology with GSAT and provides a showcase for its wider application in serious games. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Generic tool; Machine learning; Personality traits; Serious games; Statistical model; Stealth assessment; Stepwise regression","Learning systems; Machine learning; Stealth technology; Surveys; Generic tools; Personality traits; Statistical modeling; Stealth assessment; Stepwise regression; Serious games","","","","","","","Larson L.C., Miller T.N., 21st century skills: Prepare students for the future, Kappa Delta Pi Rec, 47, 3, pp. 121-123, (2011); Shute V.J., Stealth assessment in computer-based games to support learning, Comput.

However, only a limited number of studies have explored teaching of educational Game Design (GD). This paper reports a case study in which learning by designing games strategy was used to teach different viewpoints of educational GD. In order to support design activities, we proposed a CIMDELA (Content, Instruction, Mechanics, Dynamics, Engagement, Learning Analytics) framework that aims to align game design and instructional design aspects. Thirty under-graduate students participated in the gamified workshop and designed math games in teams. The activities were divided into eight rounds consisting of design decisions and game testing. The workshop activities were observed and the designed games saved. Most of the students were engaged in the design activities and particularly the approach that allowed students to test the evolving game after each round, motivated students. Observations revealed that some of the students had isolated design mindset in the beginning and they had problems to consider design decisions from game design and instructional perspectives, but team-based design activities often led to fruitful debate with co-designers and helped some students to expand their mindsets. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Design mindset; Educational game; Game design; Game-based learning","Design; Education computing; Design activity; Design decisions; Educational game; Game design; Game-based Learning; Graduate students; Instructional designs; Support design; Students","","","","","European Social Fund, ESF","The educational GD workshop was held as a part of HYPE, which is a three-year long project funded by European Social Fund (ESF).

This study investigates digital game use of teachers at compulsory and upper secondary school levels in Sweden. Data were collected from 181 respondents during spring 2019 through an online survey. Cluster analysis and descriptive statistics are used to establish the characteristics of game-using teachers and explore their teaching practices, challenges, and professional development needs. Based on their disposition, three subsets of gameusing teachers are identified. Findings indicate that a more positive disposition is related to increased pedagogical integration, a greater variety of game use, higher and more varied educational outcomes, as well as interest in professional development. Perceptions of inhibiting factors of games-based teaching tend to shift with teachers’ level of game-based teaching competency. Results highlight teachers’ need for good quality games with curricular relevance as well as relevant professional development options. Moreover, the potential of games to facilitate a collaborative form of learning and skill development may not have been yet fully realized in Swedish schools. Future research should have a twofold focus; the development of adequate game resources that can support collaborative forms of learning and higher-level skills development, as well as competency development solutions for teachers relevant to their needs. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Digital games-based teaching; Educational games; Games-based learning","Cluster analysis; Computer games; Professional aspects; Surveys; Competency development; Descriptive statistics; Digital games; Educational game; Games-based learning; Inhibiting factors; Professional development; Skills development; Education computing","","","","","","","Connolly T.C., Boyle E.A., Hainey T., McArthur E., Boyle J.M., A systematic literature review of empirical evidence on computer games and serious games, Comput.

Interactive spatial storytelling becomes a powerful tool for creating experiences of mixed reality where the story is related to specific facts that occurred in the same location in which the player is physically present. Moreover, player’s immersion in mixed reality is increased when she follows or enacts as a real character of a historically documented story, infused with imaginative elements in accordance to the objectives of the game. Following this line of thought, we introduce the location-based mobile game “Inside Old Town of Athens”, and its accompanying website, in which we creatively combine elements and principles of interactive storytelling with the distinctive attributes of location-based games that generate site-specific experiences. We also, discuss our design choices that concern the integration of the story scenario and game structure with the route in the area of Plaka, in Athens, as well as the graphic and interaction design of the mobile application that stimulate and enable the player to act in both digital and physical space. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Interactive storytelling; Location-based game; Mixed reality","Location; Interaction design; Interactive stories; Interactive storytelling; Location based; Location based games; Mobile applications; Mobile games; Site-specific; Mixed reality","","","","","","","Montola M., Stenros J., Waern A., Pervasive Games: Theory and Design, (2009); de Souza e Silva A., From cyber to hybrid: Mobile technologies as interfaces of hybrid spaces, SAGE J., 9, 3, pp. 261-278, (2006); Crawford C., Chris Crawford on Interactive Storytelling, (2012); Avouris N., Yiannoutsou N., A review of mobile location-based games for learning across physical and virtual spaces, J.

Emotion regulation, however, is a skill that ranges between individuals and often does not reach appropriate patterns of development all the way into adulthood. Current research in the field suggests that the ability is trainable. This research aimed at identifying the design requirements for the development of a digital touchscreen game with the long-term goal of enhancing children’s awareness regarding their emotion regulation (ER). A review of the literature suggested that in order to achieve the aforementioned goal, such a game needed to take the form of a story-creation activity and elicit (self-) reflection regarding ER strategy use. Based on theoretical considerations, it was proposed that a metacognitive approach, facilitated by questions, would succeed in promoting the above aims. The present paper, aims to present the implementation of this approach into a story-creation game and, in particular, describe the process of incorporating metacognitive theories of learning into the design choices. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Educational games; Emotion regulation; Metacognitive learning","Game theory; Educational game; Emotion regulations; Long-term goals; Meta-cognitive learning; Metacognitives; Patterns of development; Strategy use; Theories of learning; Serious games","","","","","","","Alexander P.A., Judy J.E., The interaction of domain-specific and strategic knowledge in academic performance, Rev.

Proponents of procedural rhetoric claim that representation through rule-based systems is crucial for the effectiveness of serious games. Yet, this claim has never been thoroughly tested in empirical research. One possible way of testing the effects of procedural rhetoric is by way of value-added research. This approach has been successfully applied in studies on multimedia learning materials as well as serious games. Nevertheless, in the case of procedural rhetoric, the value-added research approach poses considerable challenges. These challenges arise from the complex relationship between procedural representation and other game elements and modes of communication. The aim of this paper is to overcome these challenges through the operationalization of procedural rhetoric. We propose an analysis procedure based on multi-modal analysis methods combined with existing game analysis frameworks. We illustrate this procedure using an example analysis of the game We Become What We Behold (2016). The proposed procedure enables both a formal comparison and analysis of the examined game modifications, something which is indispensable when designing experiments that adopt the value-added research approach. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Multi-modal analysis; Operational definition; Procedural rhetoric; Value-added research method","Modal analysis; Comparison and analysis; Complex relationships; Game-based Learning; Multi-media learning; Operational definition; Procedural Representations; Procedural rhetorics; research methods; Serious games","","","","","Univerzita Karlova v Praze, UK, (PRIMUS/HUM/03); European Regional Development Fund, FEDER, (CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_019/0000734)","Funding text 1: Acknowledgments.

Iconoscope is a freeform creation game which aims to foster the creativity of its users through diagrammatic lateral thinking, as users are required to depict abstract concepts as icons which may be misinterpreted by other users as different abstract concepts. From users’ responses collected from an online gallery of all icons drawn with Iconoscope, we collect a corpus of over 500 icons which contain annotations of visual appeal. Several machine learning algorithms are tested for their ability to predict the appeal of an icon from its visual appearance and other properties. Findings show the impact of the representation on the model’s accuracy and highlight how such a predictive model of quality can be applied to evaluate new icons (human-authored or generated). © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Computational creators; Crowdsourcing; Deep learning; Human creativity; Mixed-initiative design; Online game","Crowdsourcing; Deep learning; Social networking (online); Abstract concept; Computational creators; Continuous operation; Human creativity; Mixed initiative; On-line games; Predictive modeling; Visual appearance; Learning algorithms","","","","","","","Ballard D.H., Hinton G.E., Sejnowski T.J., Parallel visual computation, Nature, 306, 5938, (1983); Cachia R., Et al., Creativity in Schools in Europe: A Survey of Teachers, (2009); Clevert D.A., Unterthiner T., Hochreiter S., Fast and Accurate Deep Network Learning by Exponential Linear Units (Elus), (2015); de Bono E., Lateral Thinking: Creativity Step by Step, (2010); Goodfellow I., Bengio Y., Courville A., Deep Learning, (2016); Ioffe S., Szegedy C., Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift, (2015); Jeffrey B., Craft A., Teaching creatively and teaching for creativity: Distinctions and relationships, Educ.

The paper focuses on the creation of a digital cultural SG, named “The stolen painting”. The main goal of this game is to initiate users into art painting, through game activities that encourage the users to learn about some of the most famous paintings in the world and their creators. The theory of Gardner’s Multiple Intelligences (MI) is used for game profile identification through social media data mining techniques, or alternatively, through Multiple Intelligences Profiling Questionnaire (MIPQ) in order to reveal and quantify the different types of intellectual strengths (intelligences) that each user exhibits.

In this context, the paper proposes a structured method - ‘7 P’s of gamification - which offers a broad and comprehensive perspective of gamification based on a step-by-step process. It allows team members with limited knowledge of gamification to understand it and start to use it in a real case scenario. This method was tested in a fully online workshop that challenged four teams (nineteen students in total) to ideate gamified solutions for a Lisbon municipality, which established the conditions and desired goals. The collaborative effort between team members and facilitators during the entire process was supported by digital collaborative tools (digital workspace and communication platform). Before the workshop, a training session was conducted with all participants, followed by a survey and semi-structured interviews, conducted immediately after the workshop. Based on the findings, it was possible to conclude that participants positively assessed the ‘7 P’s of gamification’ method. This type of approach engages participants in the ideation process and facilitates the ideation of gamified solutions. The presence of facilitators was also positively highlighted, which reinforces the importance of having this type of ‘actors’ when conducting gamification practices. Further research is needed to assess this method in other work contexts as well as the influence on adoption, implementation, and outcomes of gamification. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Gamification; Ideation; Management","Surveys; Collaborative tools; Collaborative Work; Communication platforms; Multi-disciplinary teams; Real case scenarios; Semi structured interviews; Structured method; Training sessions; Gamification","","","","","","","Werbach K., (Re)Defining gamification: A process approach, PERSUASIVE 2014.

The work is performed within MUV H2020 research and innovation action. The game design, definition and features have been co-created through the involvement of different citizens and stakeholders in six European neighbourhoods. The paper discusses the game design as resulting from co-creation and co-design experiences with each neighbourhood communities involved in initial phases. The paper argues that the local co-design activities have influenced the game definition, together with the community engagement approach. The MUV gameplay approach results thus a demand-side measure able to encouraging people to sustainable mobility modes in the awareness of their potential role as agents of urban livability. The data collected by the players will be used to support a citizen-centric approach to facilitate equity and mobility justice in urban policies. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Co-creation; Community engagement; Gamification; Urban sustainable mobility","Computer science; Computers; Co-creation; Community engagement; Gamification; Initial phasis; Neighbourhood; Sustainable mobility; Urban policy; Working papers; Artificial intelligence","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (723521); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; European Commission, EC; Horizon 2020","Funding text 1: Acknowledgments.

This alternative approach aims to a citizen-centric methodology focused on needs and new services, policies and solutions enabled through digital tools and gameplay development potentials. The research presented in this paper derives to a specific approach to gameplay as a means to involve people to “move” and to interact in their neighbourhood and city in a more active and sustainable way. The paper highlights the gameplay potential as a demand-side measure to effectively contribute to a urban mobility transition towards more sustainable cities also through digital technologies [2]. The paper elaborates from the research carried out in the context of “MUV – Mobility Urban Values” project [3], funded in 2017 by the European Commission under the call Horizon 2020 “Mobility for Growth”.

In our serious game Communicate, a domain expert develops a structured, scripted scenario as a sequence of potential interactions in an authoring tool. Communicate is widely used and several domain experts have already developed over a thousand scenarios. In the original version of Communicate, a student ‘navigates’ a dialogue with a virtual character by clicking one of the multiple statement options at a step of a scenario. Open text response often requires more complex thinking from a student. In this paper we explore ways to handle open text input from a student at a step of a scenario. Our goal is to match open text to scripted statements using a Natural Language Processing (NLP) method and explore mechanisms to handle matched and unmatched input. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","","Computer aided instruction; Natural language processing systems; Scaffolds; Students; Authoring tool; Communication skills; Complex thinking; Domain experts; Learning environments; NAtural language processing; Scripted dialogue; Virtual character; Serious games","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; European Institute of Innovation and Technology, EIT","Acknowledgments.

Public buildings hold great unex-ploited opportunities towards that end. Moreover, the occupants’ behavior is an impactful factor that can potentially lead to significant energy-savings therein. Recognizing the engaging power of games towards that end, our research aim is to motivate human-driven energy conservation in an especially challenging organizational context: an art museum. Through a survey of our context, we recognized the energy-saving opportunities for employees and visitors therein. Consequently we designed and present an effective serious game that fits the special characteristics of a museum’s exhibition area, as well as the users’ requirements, thus providing a mutually engaging experience for personnel and visitors alike. We also present and discuss the results from the participation of museum visitors in the game, as well as the actual energy savings achieved. Furthermore, we discuss our collected insights while designing and applying the serious game, so that future game designers can get a head start in their own projects, by keeping the challenges that may lay ahead in mind. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Energy conservation; Engagement; Museum; Serious game","Energy conservation; Exhibitions; Museums; Personnel; Art museums; Engagement; Environmental crisis; Game designers; Museum visitor; Organizational context; Public buildings; Serious games","","","","","EU Horizon 2020 research and innovation program, (696170); Athens University of Economics and Business, AUEB","Funding text 1: Acknowledgments.

In earlier work, we explored how persuasive game mechanics may contribute to the formation of attitudes in persuasive games. As a follow-up, this paper presents four design recommendations that could increase the chance that these attitudes will actually lead to the desired behavior shown by players after the game: viz., these attitudes require the right conditions to become a predictor of the desired, post-game behavior. In order to arrive at these recommendations we looked at relevant work from the field of social psychology. Next we linked our insights to the context of persuasive game design. This yielded four conceptual design recommendations for maximizing the likelihood for an attitude influenced by a persuasive game to result in the desired behavior in the real world; 1. aligning the degree of specification of a game’s message and the desired behavior 2. emphasizing the function of the attitude to be influenced 3. enabling players to reflect on their internal states 4. emphasizing personal relevance of an attitude to a behavioral choice So far, these recommendations are still theoretical in nature. We therefore discuss how future work should empirically examine these, including their implications for the effective use of persuasive game mechanics. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Attitude-behavior relationship; Persuasive game design; Persuasive games; Societal interventions","Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Attitude-behavior relationship; Design recommendations; Game design; Internal state; Persuasive games; Social psychology; Societal interventions; Societal issues; Conceptual design","","","","","","","Kuhlmann S., Rip A., Next-generation innovation policy and grand challenges, Sci.

This high barrier to entry for inexperienced designers attempting to employ serious games has not been addressed in a commonly available or recognized step-by-step game design framework. This paper creates a framework which uses the Mechanics, Dynamics, and Aesthetics (MDA) design process as the cornerstone of a step-by-step design matrix targeted at new game designers. It empowers someone with a minimal background in game design to have a much greater level of effectiveness. This is accomplished by using learning objectives and environmental constraints to map ideal game dynamics and game mechanics. A static analysis of existing games is used to assess the effectiveness of the game dynamic and game mechanics mapping matrix. A dynamic analysis of the framework is conducted by creating a cyber education focused serious game using the learning objectives and environmental constraints from an active classroom.","Design process; Game design; Serious games","Design; Mechanics; Academic environment; Cyber educations; Design process; Environmental constraints; Game design; Integrated learning; Learning objectives; Student engagement; Serious games","","","","","","","Abt C.C., Serious Games, (1987); Arnab S., Et al., Mapping learning and game mechanics for serious games analysis, Br.

The toolchain relies on the open source Measurify Internet of Things (IoT) framework, and particularly takes advantage of its edge computing extension (namely, Edgine), which can be seamlessly deployed cross-platform on embedded devices and PCs as well. The Edgine is programmed to download from Measurify a set of scripts, that are periodically executed so to get data from sensors, pre-process them and send the extracted information to the Measurify APIs. Virtual sensors can be built in game engine scripts. This paper describes the implementation of the plug-in which deploys Edgine in Unity 3D, allowing an easy delivery of virtual sensor information to Measurify. Just as a proof of concept, we present the utilization of the whole chain within a trivial game scene, showing the application development efficiency provided by a tool which is made available open source to researchers and developers. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Game development; Game engine plug-in; Internet of Things; Reality-enhanced games; System architecture; Virtual sensors","Internet of things; Open systems; Application development; Cross-platform; Embedded device; Game Engine; Internet of Things (IOT); Open sources; Proof of concept; Virtual sensor; Serious games","","","","","","","Loh C.S., Sheng Y., Ifenthaler D., Serious Games Analytics, (2015); Alonso-Fernandez C., Perez-Colado I., Freire M., Martinez-Ortiz I., Fernandez-Manjon B., Improving serious games analyzing learning analytics data: Lessons learned, GALA 2018.

This – with the proper cautions due to safety-can be done also for daily activities, such as driving. We have developed two modules that may be integrated as field user performance evaluators in third-party RESGs, aimed at improving driver’s fuel efficiency. They exploit vehicular signals (throttle position, engine revolutions per minute and car speed), which are easily accessible through the common On-Board Diagnostics-II (OBD-II) interface. The first module detects inefficient and risky driving manoeuvres while driving, in order to suggest improvement actions based upon fuzzy rules, derived from analyzing naturalistic driving data. The second module provides an eco-driving categorization for a drive via two indicators, fuel efficiency and throttle position values. The estimation of fuel efficiency for the whole trip relies on the mentioned signals, plus the OBD-II calculated engine load. Data from ‘enviroCar’ project’s, a naturalistic driving archive, was used in a simulation. The results are promising in terms of accuracy and encourage further steps towards more effective modules to support a better driving performance, for RESGs. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Driving pattern; Eco-driving; Fuel consumption (FC); Fuel efficiency; Gamification; Reality-enhanced serious game (RESG); Serious game (SG)","Automobile drivers; Behavioral research; Digital storage; Efficiency; Engines; Fuels; Fuzzy inference; Gamification; Driving pattern; Driving performance; Eco-driving; Fuel efficiency; On board diagnostics; Reality-enhanced serious game (RESG); Revolutions per minutes; User performance; Serious games","","","","","University of Genova; enviroCar open Citizen Science Platform; Queen Mary University of London, QMUL","This research was partially funded as part of a Joint Doctorate Interactive and Cognitive Environments (JD-ICE) between the University of Genova, Elios Lab, in agreement with Queen Mary University of London.

Dungeons and Dragons (D&D), a table-top roleplaying games system developed by Gygax and Arneson, utilises a host of game mechanics such as, but not limited to: character creation, customisation, skills development, leveling over time, story-telling and a game-masters feedback. Many of the game mechanics in D&D, require the player to self-reflect on behalf of their character and continually assess how they wish their character to develop for future game sessions. Coupled with interactive feedback (visual/written/auditory/narrative-development) that is provided throughout each game session from a game master who leads the players through a pre-developed story, the basis of the mechanics provides some similarities to a facilitator leading learners through an assignment. In this paper, the authors present a playful example of how roleplaying games can be used to facilitate student self-reflection. A discussion of the design, method and mid-pilot feedback of n = 11 students undertaking the Dungeons & Dragons Self-Reflection Tool is presented alongside next stage pilot trials and considerations of future work. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Dungeons and Dragons; Role-playing; Self-reflection","Mechanics; Customisation; Dungeons and Dragons; Interactive feedback; Role playing; Role-playing game; Self reflection; Skills development; Story telling; Students","","","","","Arts and Humanities Research Council, AHRC, (AH/P013937/1)","","Dewey J., How We Think, (1997); Moon J.A., Learning Journals: A Handbook for Academics, Students and Professional Development, (1999); Mann K., Gordon J., Macleod A., Reflection and reflective practice in health professions education: A systematic review, Adv.

The video game industry faces challenges with the increase in players’ numbers and application areas including serious games. The increase in the number of players includes disabled players. Therefore, serious games have to consider these audiences who may be affected by one or more temporary or ongoing disabilities. Universally accessible games (UA-Games) aim to create interfaces that can be accessed and manipulated by the largest number of players. Currently few serious games include accessibility features, while accessibility should be considered at the beginning of the serious game design. Then how can we help designers and developers to include accessible features in an existing serious game? To this end, game engines must be efficient but also scalable and modular. This paper studies the interest of the Entity-Component-System (ECS) software architecture to integrate accessibility features in an existing serious game. As a case study, we will take a serious game developed with ECS yet not accessible: E-LearningScape. We will present the accessible features that we have integrated into the serious game and discuss the pros and cons of this approach. This feedback shows us that ECS provides very useful design flexibility to integrate unanticipated interaction features into serious games. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Accessibility feature; Data oriented programming; Entity-Component-System; Serious games; Software architecture; Universal design","Human computer interaction; Software architecture; Application area; Component systems; Design flexibility; Game Engine; Integral part; Interaction features; Popular cultures; Video game industry; Serious games","","","","","","","(2020); Grammenos D., Savidis A., Stephanidis C., Designing universally accessible games, ACM Comput.

The proposed rewarding system consists of two types of rewards, those that are automatically provided by Moodle and those that are provided manually by the tutor. The specific rewarding system follows the principles of the Gamified e-Learning Model, focusing on the way students should be rewarded in order to become engaged in the course and form a Community of Inquiry. An empirical study in which the proposed rewarding system was implemented in a blended learning course on educational technology, is described. The rewards provided by the teacher are based on analysis of the Moodle log files and data collected for each student using a learning analytics tool.

The narrative of the game is based in the history of mathematics and, to win, the player needs to travel through time, starting from the ancient Egypt and finishing at the modern world. To achieve that, the player interacts with real-life characters, such as Pythagoras of Samos, learning about their contributions to the field and using this knowledge to solve puzzles. The aim of the research presented in this paper is to understand the effects of the game on students’ mathematics performance and levels of mathematics anxiety, a clinical condition where feelings of tension emerge during the manipulation of numbers. The game was tested by children from the first and second classes of Irish primary schools (n = 88). Students played the game for 3 weeks on weekly sessions of 45 min to 1 h. The experiment had a pre post-test design and students answered the Modified Abbreviated Math Anxiety Scale (mAMAS), and a mathematics test designed based on the content of the game. Statistical analysis suggested the game significantly improves students’ mathematics performance. However, it increases the levels of mathematics anxiety on female students, opening discussion for considering what aspects of game design influences the levels of mathematics anxiety for this specific group. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","History of mathematics; Mathematics anxiety; Primary school","Clinical research; Ancient Egypt; Clinical conditions; Design and evaluations; Female students; Game design; Primary schools; Pythagoras; Second class; Students","","","","","","","Conway P., Sloane F., International Trends in Post-Primary Mathematics Education: Perspectives on Learning, Teaching and Assessment, (2006); Di Martino P., Zan R., “Me and maths”: Towards a definition of attitude grounded on stu-dents’ narratives, J.

A self-assessment test was given to the participants, and bio-sensors were used to detect the effect of frustration on both heart rate and skin conductivity. The results indicated that participants with high extraversion performed better under frustration, while those with high conscientiousness or high neuroticism had a decrease in performance. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Affective computing; Big five traits; Frustration; Frustration mode; Performance","Computer science; Computers; Affective Computing; Big five; Frustration; Frustration mode; Performance; Artificial intelligence","","","","","","","Picard R.W., Affective Computing M.I.T Media Laboratory Perceptual Computing Section; Nakasone A., Prendinger H., Ishizuka M., Emotion recognition from electromyography and skin conductance, Proceedings of the 5Th International Workshop on Biosignal Interpretation, pp. 219-222, (2005); Andalib T.W., Darun M.R., Azizan A., Frustration of employees: Reasons, dimensions and resolving techniques, WCIK E J.

These mobile devices can enhance teaching in many ways. Mobile Learning Games (MLGs) for example, have shown great potential for increasing student’s motivation and improving the quality of situated learning. For the past few years, the research community has been working on authoring tools that allow teachers to create and distribute their own MLGs. The development of these authoring tools is challenging and time consuming and even more so if the objective is for these tools to actually be used in classrooms. The Design-Based Research (DBR) paradigm was precisely developed to address these central issues of Technology Enhanced Learning. It involves co-designing and testing with end-users from the beginning of the project. Although DBR increases the acceptance of new educational tools, it also adds several challenges, including the complexity of involving teachers and students in real-world situations and creating several versions of the tools that will be improved iteratively. In this paper, we aim at providing design principles and practical guidance on the way to develop such authoring tools, based on our experience. We conclude on lessons learned from this project and discuss some systematic issues we faced. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Authoring tool; Design-Based Research; Game-based learning; Mobile Learning; Situated learning","Students; Authoring tool; Design-based research; Game-based Learning; Mobile Learning; Situated learning; E-learning","","","","","","","Marfisi-Schottman I., George S., Supporting teachers to design and use mobile collaborative learning games, Proceedings of the International Conference on Mobile Learning, pp. 3-10, (2014); Bianchi-Berthouze N., Understanding the role of body movement in player engagement, Hum.

A multimodal learning environment was created so that learners could engage in a digital storytelling process. Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected (pre/post test, teacher/researcher’s journal, semi-structured interviews with students). The effectiveness and applicability of the intervention on learners’ vocabulary and intercultural understanding were examined. The results indicated the positive effects of the project on learners’ communicative competence. Among the learning gains were the acquisition of topic-related vocabulary, the development of collaborative skills, as well as gains regarding intercultural understanding and digital literacy. Additionally, both teacher and learners’ assumptions lead to the conclusion of an exciting learning experience, indicating that language learning was a motivating and intriguing process. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Digital storytelling; Foreign language learning; Intercultural awareness","Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Communicative competences; Digital storytelling; English-as-a-Foreign-Language; Foreign language learning; Intercultural awareness; Learning experiences; Multi-modal learning; Semi structured interviews; Computer aided instruction","","","","","","","Ho S.T.K., Addressing culture in EFL classrooms: The challenge of shifting from a traditional to an intercultural stance, Electron.

The workflow combines existing research for serious games design with novel systematic analysis techniques for learning and game mechanics and gameplay loops to improve the understanding and rigour of the process. A detailed worked example applies the workflow to the development of a serious tabletop game with the educational goal of increasing knowledge and confidence of performing postgraduate literature reviews. Systematic application of the workflow to a real example supports the value of this approach and provides a useful template for educators to follow for increasing the quality and feasibility of self-designed serious games. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Board games; Game-based learning; Modding; Serious games","Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Board games; Educational goals; Game-based Learning; Learning objectives; Literature reviews; Modding; Serious games designs; Systematic analysis; Serious games","","","","","","","Clark D.B., Tanner-Smith E.E., Killingsworth S.S., Digital games, design, and learning: A systematic review and meta-analysis, Rev.

We analyze this approach in a virtual reality serious game dedicated to people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Knowing that heart rate is a good indicator of the emotional state of people with PTSD, we collect this variable in real-time to propose a virtual reality dynamic adjusted system based on the emotional state of the subject. The proposed adaptation system can be approached in three modes: the offline mode which consists on therapist selections before launching the game, the manual online mode during which the therapist can adapt the virtual environment while the subject is exposed, and the computational online mode that runs a DDA algorithm to automatically adjust the game. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Adaptivity; Heart rate; Physiological feedback; PTSD; Serious game; Virtual reality","Virtual reality; Adaptation systems; DDA algorithms; Emotional state; Heart rates; Offline modes; Online modes; Posttraumatic stress disorder; Virtual reality exposure therapies; Serious games","","","","","","","Menelas B.-A.J., Benaoudia R.S., Use of haptics to promote learning outcomes in serious games, Multimod.

In France, this educational reform was very sudden and many teachers are not yet trained adequately to teach this subject, leaving them in search of guidelines and tools to help them. It is in this context that we propose TurtleTable, an educational game, who has two main originalities. First of all, this game is not based on writing a computer program, like most of the other tools, but rather on executing a given program, step by step. These two approaches are complementary and essential to apprehend the logic behind computer programming. Secondly, TurtleTable is played in groups of three, by manipulating Tangible objects on an Interactive Tabletop (TIT). The players have to collaboratively move the objects on a grid, by following the instructions of the program on the screen. The game immediately indicates which instructions are executed correctly, allowing the learners to correct their mistakes. TurtleTable was tested by 59 middle school students. We developed four different interactions for TurtleTable (TIT, tabletop, tablet and computer) to compare their effects on motivation, collaboration and learning. The preliminary analysis show that the students really appreciated the game, especially the TIT version, that encouraged collaboration and gave them the impression they learned more. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Algorithm; Computer programming; Interactive tabletop; Learning games; Serious games; Tangible object","Algorithms; Curricula; Interactive devices; Serious games; Students; Educational game; Educational reforms; Interactive tabletop; Learning game; Middle school students; Preliminary analysis; Tangible interaction; Tangible objects; Computer programming","","","","","","","One of the Main French Website with Various Unplugged Activities to Help Teachers Teach Computer Science, (2018); (2018); Logo Turtle; Kubicki S., Pasco D., Arnaud I., Using a serious game with a tangible tabletop interface to promote student engagement in a first grade classroom: A comparative evaluation study, Int.

Combining both methods, we present a multiplayer Serious-AR-Game for Celtic Life and History. As a game the player experiences fun and competition which leads to intrinsic motivation. In contrast to existing games with a Celtic theme, our approach has been focused on historical accuracy to ensure a learning-centered foundation. The goal is to build a Celtic village with a functioning economic cycle. Especially by interacting in AR, the game becomes more perceptible, intriguing and vivid. Based on tangibles (markers tracked by a camera), playful, interactable replications of historically accurate Celtic buildings can be explored. The player can see their interior and also get information about the Celts by interacting with various objects or tools of their daily life. The collected knowledge is necessary to succeed in the ‘quiz-war’ against an opponent. This project was evaluated (N = 20) based on a questionnaire (GEQ) [10] to measure the game experience as well as the transferred knowledge and to get directed feedback for further development. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Augmented reality games; Flow; Interactive learning environments; Serious games","Augmented reality; Computer aided instruction; Cultural heritages; Economic cycles; Flow; Game experience; Interactive learning environment; Intrinsic motivation; Multiplayers; Player experience; Serious games","","","","","","","Admiraal W., Huizenga J., Akkerman S., Ten Dam G., The concept of flow in collaborative game-based learning, Comput.

The game is analyzed in order to find the aspects that need to be improved (i.e. problems players might have with learning how to use and handle the game). Based on these findings the implementation of the pedagogical agent and the methods used are presented and elaborated. Furthermore, the question whether a pedagogical agent can improve the learnability of game mechanics in serious games compared to the “Standard form contract”style tutorials used in Lost Earth 2307, is discussed. A study about the evaluation of the implemented pedagogical agent, its research question and the metrics used, is presented.

Novel within the study is the use of psychophysiological measures (galvanic skin response and heart rate) as ways to organize specific game events for later interview sessions. Card sorting was used as a projective technique in the interviews as a way to have participants talk about their emotional states. The psychophysiological data, measured by Mionix Naos QG mouse, was used to support self-reported methods consisting of a questionnaire and interviews. The study is based on 28 university students, and tested in a lab environment to minimize external distractions. The game was designed with three different scenarios, and it was concluded that one scenario in particular successfully simulated an emotional sense of what is like to have social anxiety disorder. There is still much future work to do on how to use and interpret psychophysiological measurement within game research. There is also potential for increased validity and reliability using methods other than self-reports, especially with emotional engagement as a research focus. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Card sorting; Game design; Psychophysiological methods; Serious games; Social anxiety disorder","Electrophysiology; Sorting; Surveys; Card-sorting; Emotional engagements; Galvanic skin response; Game design; Psychophysiological measures; Psychophysiological methods; Social anxieties; University students; Serious games","","","","","","","Purdon C., Antony M., Monteiro S., Swinson R.P., Social anxiety in college students, J.

Therefore, theoretically sound mechanisms for gaining a certain level of understanding of learning and gaming processes by the game is crucial. Consequently, AI and machine learning technologies increasingly enter the field. These technologies often fail, however, since serious games either pose highly complex problems (combining gaming and learning process) or do not provide the extensive data bases that would be required. One solution might be allowing human intelligence or intuition influence AI processes. In the present study, we investigated pathfinding algorithms with and without human interventions to the algorithms. As a testbed, we used a clone of the Travelling Salesman problem, the Travelling Snakesman game. We found some evidence that in this particular pathfinding problem human interventions result in superior results as the MAXMIN Ant System algorithm. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Ant colony systems; Game AI; Human in the loop","Ant colony optimization; Artificial intelligence; Learning systems; Traveling salesman problem; Ant colony systems; Game AI; Human intelligence; Human-in-the-loop; Learning experiences; Machine learning technology; Path-finding algorithms; Travelling salesman problem; Serious games","","","","","","","Silver D., Et al., Mastering the game of Go with deep neural networks and tree search, Nature, 529, 7587, pp. 484-489, (2016); Wouters P.J.M., van Nimwegen C., van Oostendorp H., van der Spek E.D., A meta-analysis of the cognitive and motivational effects of serious games, J.

People can use apps to exercise more, eat healthier, or learn a new skill, but and digital interventions and games are also used by policy makers and companies to create a safe environment for the general public or to increase sales. Given this interest in behavior change, it is not surprising that this topic has seen a lot of interest from the scientific community. This has resulted in a wide range of theories and techniques to bring about behavior change. However, maintaining behavior change is rarely addressed, and as a result poorly understood. In this paper, we take a first step in the design of digital interventions for long-term behavior change by placing a range of behavior change techniques on a long-term behavior change timeline. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Behavior change; Behavior change techniques; Long-term effects","Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Behavior change; General publics; Long-term behavior; Long-term effects; Policy makers; Scientific community; Behavioral research","","","","","","","Allen K., Chronic nailbiting: A controlled comparison of competing response and mild aversion treatments, Behav.

During a limited time, a team of learners collaboratively solves puzzles related to educational content. For learners, the aim consists of “escaping” from a room. For educators, an escape-game contextualizes an educational content into a meaningful and inspiring experience based on game-based and collaborative learning. This paper deals with the implementation of what we call educational escape game with the focus on the process dedicated to decontextualize the knowledge after a game session. We want to get a better understanding of debriefing so that practice can improve. The paper is based on an empirical study carried out with teachers/trainers experienced in implementing educational escape games. The paper is organized as follow. We (1) provide with a brief review of literature on debriefing and we argue for the adoption of the term “institutionalization”, a concept enabling to take into consideration the transformation of knowledge after a game session. We (2) propose a definition for educational escape-game based on a literature review and the systematic analysis of 2 French databases of educational escape games and (3) we discuss the results of an empirical work aiming at understanding how educators carry out the debriefing session which follows the time dedicated to play. According to our theoretical framework, debriefing consists of a process aiming at the transformation of the subjective and situated knowledge developed during the game into objective and transferable knowledge. Interviews and questionnaires conducted with three teachers enable to describe this process in terms of time (chronogenesis), role played by participants (topogenesis) and the settings (objects and relationships between objects) in which this process takes place (mesogenesis). These findings offer the opportunity for new guidelines for the design of debriefing sessions. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Chronogenesis; Debriefing; Escape game; Game-based learning; Institutionalization; Mesogenesis; Topogenesis","Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Chronogenesis; Debriefing; Escape game; Game-based Learning; Institutionalization; Mesogenesis; Topogenesis; Surveys","","","","","","","Jenkins H., Clinton K., Purushotma R., Robison A.J., Weigel M., Confronting the Challenges of Participatory Culture: Media Education for the 21St Century, (2006); Garris R., Ahlers R., Driskell J.E., Games, motivation, and learning: A research and practice model, Simul.

We discuss a mixed research methods approach, based on the Q methodology and a simulation game. In a game design process, translating the real or reference system into the game design is an intricate process and rather challenging due to the complexity of today’s societal systems. As shown by various studies, different data techniques are proposed in order to translate reality aspects. One of the proposed data gathering techniques in combination with simulation games is Q methodology. Q methodology is a suitable method to retrieve social perspectives of stakeholders on a particular topic. Yet it is still elusive how the results of a Q methodology can be used in a game design process. In this paper, we explore the possibilities how to combine the two methods and how to translate the results of the Q analysis into a game design concept. In the context of a case within the domain of transport and logistics, we discuss how such mixed research methods approach could look like. We conclude with a future outlook on our research. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Game mechanics; Mixed method approach; Q methodology; Simulation games","Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Data gathering; Game design; Mixed method; Q methodology; Reference systems; Simulation games; Social perspective; Societal systems; Computer aided software engineering","","","","","","","Duke R.D., Gaming: The Future’s Language, (1974); Harteveld C., Triadic Game Design: Balancing Reality, Meaning and Play, 1st edn, Springer, London, (2011); Kriz W.C., Creating effective learning environments and learning organizations through gaming simulation design, Simul.

They evolved in various domains, especially in the healthcare field. Healthcare professional experts and trainers indicate the importance of designing educational environments and educational programs in order to reproduce with high fidelity the professional context. Therefore, data gained through gaming is explored and exploited to extract information about the learning strategies. In this work, we explore data that was collected during courses in which students used a simulation game called CLONE (Clinical Organizer Nurse Education). This serious game has been designed to train nursing students in work organizations. With the implementation of statistical approaches, we intended to study factors that impact on the success of the game. Considering game sessions from 3 different angles, we try to answer the following questions: 1) Does the duration of the game session has an impact on gaming outcomes? 2) Which errors do students commit during the game? 3) Do students achieve learning progress by repeating the game?

Nevertheless, gaming performance and subjective game experience were hardly examined across adult age groups for which the game was not intended to. In contrast to serious games as specific tools against a natural, age-related decline in cognitive performance, we evaluated performance and subjective experiences of the established math learning game Semideus across three age groups from 19 to 79. Observed decline in performance in terms of processing speed were not exclusively predicted by age, but also by gaming frequency. Strongest age-related drops of processing speed were found for the middle-aged group aged 35 to 59 years. On the other hand, more knowledge-dependent performance measures like the amount of correctly solved problems remained comparably stable. According to subjective ratings, the middle-aged group experienced the game as less fluent and automatic compared to the younger and older groups. Additionally, the elderly group of participants reported fewer negative attitudes towards technology than both younger groups. We conclude that, albeit performance differences with respect to processing speed, subjective gaming experience stayed on an overall high positive level. This further encourages the use of games for learning across age. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Applicability; Elderly; Game-based learning; Life-long learning; Number-line estimation; Reliability; User-experience","E-learning; Reliability; User experience; Applicability; Elderly; Game-based Learning; Life long learning; Line estimation; Serious games","","","","","","","Lenhart A., Kahne J., Middaugh E., Macgill A.R., Evans C., Vitak J., Teens’ Gaming Experiences are Diverse and Include Significant Social Interaction and Civic Engagement, (2008); (2019); Huizinga J., Flitner A., Homo Ludens: Vom Ursprung Der Kultur Im Spiel, (2017); Hainey T., Connolly T.M., Boyle E.A., Wilson A., Razak A., A systematic literature review of games-based learning empirical evidence in primary education, Comput.

However, just making plans is not enough to expect positive outcomes such as no fatalities or injuries. Even a carefully devised evacuation plan becomes worthless if it is not adopted fully. Emergency training and repetitive drills are being carried out to educate people but in most situations, this training is dull. Consequently, the trend is towards other means of delivering emergency education such as games and entertainment. To understand peoples’ attitudes towards real drills as well as serious game based training, we developed a game for university students. The game models the university structure and shows fire erupted at certain parts of the university. The player has to evacuate using their knowledge of emergency exits and take other actions like dial an emergency number etc. After gameplay, the participants were interviewed about their preferred means of emergency education. The responses obtained demonstrate how participants feel about the seriousness of emergencies and which means of training (games based or drills) they deem productive for themselves. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Conventional drills; Emergency training modes; Gamification; Serious game","Drills; Education computing; Gamification; Infill drilling; Emergency educations; Emergency evacuation; Emergency training; Evacuation plans; Game models; Game-based trainings; Gameplay; University students; Serious games","","","","","","","Arnab S., Et al., Mapping learning and game mechanics for serious games analysis, Br.

SGs are used in various sectors with quite promising results. One field that SGs are used is education, since SGs are considered to offer promising technology enhanced learning opportunities. This paper focuses on SGs that aim to deal with the limitations that people with Intellectual Disabilities (ID) and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) have in acquiring conceptual, social, practical and cognitive skills. In particular, we present the results of a questionnaire designed to investigate the perceptions of special education professionals and teachers regarding the use of SGs in the education of people with ID and ASD. Specifically, we investigate the usefulness and the effectiveness of SGs as teaching/learning tools, the ease of use by people with ID and ASD, and the ideal age group for SGs targeted to various skills. Ninety-three special education professionals and teachers participated in the study. The participants evaluated positively SGs for all the examined skills in terms of their usefulness, usability and effectiveness. Moreover, we recorded some interesting implications that can assist the design of SGs for people with ID and ASD, as well as open issues for further research. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Autism Spectrum Disorder; Intellectual Disabilities; Participatory design; Serious Games; Serious games design","Diseases; Surveys; Autism spectrum disorders; Cognitive skill; Intellectual disability; Participatory design; Serious games designs; Special education; Teaching/learning; Technology enhanced learning; Serious games","","","","","University of Macedonia Research Committee","Acknowledgments.

Using a design-based research methodology, our goal consists of modeling debriefing and helping teachers to implement debriefing into their teaching practices. This model has been tested during experimentations carried out in upper secondary classes (15–17 years old) in Switzerland. Four game-based courses using the game “Programming Game” have been analyzed. In this paper we focus on the debriefing phase. In order to identify how knowledge is processed during the debriefing, we used an annotation software for categorizing interactions between the teacher and the students. Results show that practices differ among teachers regarding debriefing and that the processing of knowledge (named institutionalization) is not fully performed. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Computational thinking; Debriefing/institutionalization; Game-based-learning","Education computing; Computational thinkings; Computer education; Debriefing/institutionalization; Design-based research; Empirical studies; Game-based Learning; Knowledge processing; Teaching practices; Computer games","","","","","","","Sanchez E., Game-based learning, Encyclopedia of Education and Information Technologies, pp. 1-9, (2019); Serious Game, (2018); Sanchez E., Monod-Ansaldi R., Vincent C., Safadi-Katouzian S., A praxeological perspective for the design and implementation of a digital role-play game, Educ.

Through a case study and an exploratory, qualitative approach we identify aspects involved such as the content, the goals, the pedagogical approaches, the settings, the role of fun and playfulness, challenges, and the role of the practitioner. Data was collected through interviews and a survey. Despite the diversity in the format, settings, structure, and target group of the practices examined in this study, there seems to be a convergence in certain themes such as the objectives of the practices, the pedagogical approaches involved, and the importance of fun. These aspects are linked with the design and implementation of digital games in the context of informal and non-formal science learning. Further issues emerged from the analysis such as gender representation, resources required for efficient implementation of practices, and the role of the parents. Strengthening the links between formal and informal or non-formal science learning practices could benefit not only formal education but access of students to and effectiveness of non-formal and informal practices as well. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Digital games; Game based learning; Informal learning; Non-formal learning; Science learning","Computer games; Digital games; Game-based Learning; Informal learning; Non-formal learning; Science learning; E-learning","","","","","European Commission, EC; Horizon 2020","Acknowledgments.

In our serious game Communicate, a domain expert develops a structured, scripted scenario as a sequence of potential interactions in an authoring tool. A player is often a student learning communication skills and a virtual character represents a person that a student talks to. In the original version of Communicate, a player ‘converses’ with a virtual character by clicking on one of the multiple statement options. Since 2018, we perform blended learning sessions for final year computer science students using Communicate. Our goal is to improve these sessions and in this paper, we apply the action research method over three semesters to iteratively improve these blended learning sessions. In the first semester, our baseline, we conduct sessions where students play a scenario in multiple choice format. In the second semester, we enhance Communicate by enabling a student to enter open text input in an improved scenario. In the third semester, we enhance a session by incorporating peer teaching. Students fill in an evaluation survey after a session and we compare the evaluation of students from the three semesters. Results show that student ratings are significantly higher in sessions incorporating peer teaching compared to the baseline. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","","Iterative methods; Students; Action research; Blended learning; Communication skills; Computer science students; Multiple-choice formats; Scripted dialogue; Student learning; Virtual character; Serious games","","","","","644187 EC H2020; European Institute of Innovation and Technology, EIT; Universiteit Utrecht, UU; , (644187)","Funding text 1: Acknowledgments.

Due to its complexity, it can be best defined by different aspects of music like pitch, harmony, etc. Scientists believe that musicality is not an inherent trait possessed only by musicians but something anyone can nurture and train in themselves. In this paper we present a new game, named Musicality, that aims at measuring and improving the musicality of any person with some interest in music. Our application offers users a fun, quick, interactive way to accomplish this goal at their own pace. Specifically, our game focuses on three of the most basic aspects of musicality: instrument recognition, tempo and tone. For each aspect we created different mini-games in order to make training a varied and attractive activity. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","","Computer science; Computers; Instrument recognition; Interactive way; Artificial intelligence","","","","","","","Musicality Test Reveals UK’s ‘untapped talent’; BBC Lab UK: How Musical are You?; Musical-U Ear Training Exercises; Perfect Ear-Ear Trainer, (2018); Google: Android Mediaplayer Api, (2018); Honing H., Ten Cate C., Peretz I., Trehub S., Without It No Music: Cognition, Biology and Evolution of Musicality, (2015); Law L.N.C., Zentner M., Assessing musical abilities objectively: Construction and validation of the profile of music perception skills, PLOS ONE, 7, 12, pp. 1-15, (2012); Marcus G.F., Musicality: Instinct or acquired skill?, Top.

However, playful math games need to provide learners with a better experience, which is connected with an engaging gameplay. Popular game mechanics could be used in order to integrate learning in the playing activities. This research employs the Super Mario game format for the design of a playful educational serious game in the context of math education. Mario Maths is addressed to students of 12 and 13 years old and aims to the practice of divisibility criteria. Mario collects numbers instead of coins that must be exactly divided with the number-target, avoiding or eliminating the wrong answers. A wrong choice transports Mario to a subterranean world which informs him for his mistake, but with no influence on the final goal achievement according to a constructive error and trial method. In the end of each track, the player is taking feedback of his effort in a selfassessment process. Mario Maths was developed to be used as a complementary educational tool for students who might be attracted from such forms of media.

In a pretest-posttest design, an empirical study tested whether change in attitude, knowledge, engagement and behaviour with respect to energy conservation in the household was different for participants playing Powersaver Game compared to a control condition where participants used an energy dashboard with the same content, but excluding game features. The aim of this game (developed using an iterative user-centered game design methodology) is to influence household energy consumption by means of electricity and gas usage in the long-term. The intervention time was at least 5 weeks and pre and post measures based on 21 days intervals. All energy conservation activities that the application provides (e.g. washing clothes on low temperatures) take place in the real world and feedback is based on real time energy consumption. This inverse gamification principle aims to optimize the transfer between the game world and the real world. Energy consumption significantly changed in the game condition compared to the control condition, and the difference between both conditions is more than 33% after the intervention. In the game condition, knowledge about energy conservation was significantly increased, although no significant differences in increase of attitude and engagement were found. We conclude that Powersaver Game is effective in transfer of energy conservation knowledge, which leads to energy saving behaviour on the long term. It cannot be concluded that playing the game leads to a greater change in attitude, however, attitude scores of the participants were high from the start. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Behaviour change; Energy conservation; Gamification; Persuasive games","Energy transfer; Energy utilization; Iterative methods; User centered design; Behaviour changes; Conservation activities; Electricity and gas; Empirical studies; Gamification; Household energy; Household energy consumption; Persuasive games; Energy conservation","","","","","","","Adams E., Fundamentals of Game Design, (2014); Aronson E., Wilson T.D., Akert R.M., Social Psychology.

During last decades, Cultural Heritage Serious Games (CHSGs) are being developed with the use of different technologies, in order to facilitate learning of cultural heritage via an entertaining manner. Although, there are evidences about CHSGs effects, there is the need of extracting more reliable results about their effectiveness, meaning the extent to which the initial intentions achieved their purpose. Regarding CHSGs, this purpose is twofold, which means the measurements are as much about entertainment as learning. Moreover, there is the need of increasing evidences on CHSGs’ effectiveness regarding higher-cognitive processes in learning. The aim of the present paper is to describe a CHSG design and evaluation approach, which is oriented to the enhancement CHSGs effectiveness in terms of entertaining and learning, as well as the extraction of more reliable results. Regarding learning aspects, the proposed approach focuses on extracting results about cultural heritage understanding. The suggested approach will be applied in a CHSG for the understanding of the Roman Forum of Thessaloniki, Greece. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Cultural Heritage; Game design; Serious Games","Entertainment; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Cognitive process; Cultural heritages; Design and evaluations; Game design; Reliable results; Thessaloniki , Greece; Serious games","","","","","","","Tsita C., Satratzemi M., How serious games in cultural heritage are being evaluated, Proceedings of the 11Th Pan-Hellenic & International Conference, ICT in Education (HCICTE), (2018); Malegiannaki I., Daradoumis T., Analyzing the educational design, use and effect of spatial games for cultural heritage: A literature review, Comput.

In analyzing this dissonance, the paper further discusses the transcendental nature of play (Gadamer), the fact that play seems to play itself, and the delicate way in which the game insists on a meta-ethical theme while at the same time setting up utterly violent game rules and mechanics.

They oftentimes are unaware of the necessity of performing maintenance to stations, tracks, and trains. MainTrain is a serious game developed to teach commuters about rail-maintenance while simulating the difficulty of keeping passengers happy. It is a fast-paced strategy game with a top-down view in which a player can perform maintenance actions on stations, tracks, and trains. By using commuter happiness as a base metric, MainTrain attempts to elicit empathy from players dissatisfied with scheduled maintenance so that they gain a better appreciation of the need for scheduled maintenance. This is coupled with the need to schedule maintenance for several components of a rail network, encumbering a player while teaching them about different aspects of rail maintenance. To examine the effectiveness of the game, the results of a user study are presented. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Educational game; Rail maintenance; Serious game","Maintenance; Causes of delays; Educational game; Maintenance Action; Performing maintenance; Rail maintenance; Schedule maintenances; Scheduled maintenance; Strategy games; Serious games","","","","","","","2K Games and Firaxis Games: Sid Meier’s Railroads!

Companies try to somehow prepare their employees for novel, technologically-driven trends and highlight the effects of digitalization on their companies. Therefore, serious games seem to be a proper method to train employees’ skills in business-related contexts. This paper seeks to prove the need for a serious business game themed around digitalization and digital transformation by applying a qualitative research approach. Eight qualitative interviews with decision-makers in companies, universities and vocational schools were conducted in order to investigate whether such a serious game can achieve a learning effect and whether a digital transformation process can be depicted in a serious game. Data shows evidence for potential of a serious business game on digitalization and digital transformation. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Digital transformation; Digitalization; Market potential; Qualitative research; Serious business game","Decision making; Metadata; Personnel; Business games; Digital transformation; Digitalization; Market potential; Qualitative research; Serious games","","","","","","","Loebbecke C., Picot A., Reflections on societal and business model transformation arising from digitization and big data analytics, J.

Improving social functioning by training the skills needed for success in social interactions is an important, although often underrepresented part, of rehabilitation after ABI. Those who lack social functioning abilities are at risk of becoming socially isolated and typically have high levels of depression and anxiety. Therapy for social functioning after an ABI is limited, with opportunities for practise decreasing as individuals return home from in-patient care facilities. Additionally, training for social functioning is proportionally less focused on than cognitive or physical functioning. Interactive technology could offer unchartered opportunities for administering parts of this training in an efficient way. Several successful research studies have evaluated rehabilitation of ABI using games and interactive systems. However, these studies are generally focused on the rehabilitation of cognitive and physical functioning rather than the skills needed for social functioning. This paper presents the research carried out to design and preliminary validate a gameful application known as SocialMe. The findings of this research contribute to the area of rehabilitation of social functioning following ABI and the use of gameful intervention technology. The empirically researched design requirements, including interviews and collaboration with domain experts, presented in this paper could be a starting point for interventions for individuals with ABI as well as individuals with a need to learn or improve skills for full social functioning. Future research will need to be carried out to develop the concept further and evaluate its clinical significance in a randomised controlled trial to see if the use of SocialMe can lead to improvements in the social skills needed for social functioning, and to support the social reintegration of individuals with ABI. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Acquired brain injury; Gameful application; Interactive tool; Rehabilitation; Social functioning; Social skills; Stroke; Technology; Traumatic brain injury","Patient rehabilitation; Patient treatment; Acquired brain injuries; Controlled trial; Domain experts; Interactive system; Interactive technology; Physical functioning; Research studies; Social interactions; Clinical research","","","","","","","(2019); Bosc M., Assessment of social functioning in depression, Comprehensive Psychiatry, pp. 63-69, (2000); Skills Studies O.E.C.D., Learning contexts, skills and social progress: A conceptual framework, Skills for Social Progress: The Power of Social and Emotional Skills, OECD Publishing, P. 34, (2015); McDonald S., Togher L., Code C., The Nature of Traumatic Brain Injury: Basic Features and Neuropsychological Consequences, In Communication Disorders Following Traumatic Brain Injury, pp. 19-54, (1999); Bhogal S.K., Teasell R.W., Foley N.C., Speechley M.R., Community reintegation after stroke, Topics in Stroke Rehabilitation, pp. 107-129, (2003); Dores A., Et al., Virtual city neurocognitive rehabilitation of acquired brain injury, 7Th Iberian Conference on Information Systems and Technologies (CISTI), (2012); Gamito P., Et al., Cognitive training on stroke patients via virtual reality-based serious games, Disability and Rehabilitation, pp. 385-388, (2017); Sanchez L., Et al.: The use of a social assistive robot: NAO for post strokes rehabilitation therapy: A preliminary study, Computer Methods in Biomechanics and Biomedical Engineering, pp. 478-480, (2019); Cameirao M., Badia S., Oller E., Verschure P., Neurorehabilitation using the virtual reality based rehabilitation gaming system: Methodology, design, psychometrics, usability and validation, J.

We developed the game Loud and Clear in order to have them experience the difficulties of being visually impaired, as well as to put in evidence the abilities blind people have developed, which sighted people mostly lack. In this game without visuals, the player has to rely solely on audio to complete objectives within the game. The game consists of a number of puzzle rooms the player has to solve. These puzzles illustrate the challenges of being blind in a playful setting, and challenge the player to use different auditory skills that are key to achieving objectives without vision, such as sound localisation, sound recognition and spatial orientation. The game uses audio spatialisation techniques to give the player a realistic and immersive auditive experience. Preliminary tests of this game show that players acknowledge the initial high difficulty of ‘living’ as a blind person, to which eventually they were able to somehow adapt. In addition, players reported feeling both immersed and educated by the experience. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Audio game; Blindness awareness; Virtual reality","Computer science; Computers; Virtual reality; Audio games; Blind person; Blindness awareness; Localisation; Sound recognition; Spatial orientations; Visual impairment; Visually impaired; Artificial intelligence","","","","","","","Allain K., Et al., An audio game for training navigation skills of blind children, Proceedings of SIVE (IEEE VR).

Fifty-two Finnish 5th graders played the game about fractions at home during COVID-19 enforced distance learning. The results showed that flow experience correlated positively with situational interest. Importantly, a deeper analysis of the Flow Short Scale (FSS) subscales revealed that only absorption by activity but not fluency of performance explained variance in situational interest. That is, at least in game-based adaptive learning, situational interest is mostly related to immersive aspects of flow. Results also revealed that students with better in-game performance had higher flow experiences, but their levels of prior knowledge were not related to flow levels. In contrast, students with lower prior fraction number knowledge showed higher situational interest, which might be partly attributed to the additional game elements provided to struggling students in the form of adaptive scaffolds. Moreover, the study demonstrated that the developed adaptive scaffolding approach and in-game self-reporting measures worked well. Finally, the implications of these findings for flow experience and situational interest research in game-based learning context are discussed. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Adaptive scaffolding; Flow experience; Game-based learning; Mathematics; Situational interest","Distance education; Students; Adaptive learning; Flow experience; Flow level; Game elements; Game-based Learning; Learning game; Prior knowledge; Self-reporting; Scaffolds","","","","","Suomen Akatemia, (326618)","Research was funded by the Academy of Finland (grant numbers: 326618","Aleven V., McLaughlin E.A., Glenn R.A., Koedinger K.R., Instruction based on adaptive learning technologies, Handbook of Research on Learning and Instruction, pp. 522-560, (2016); Siegler R.S., Fazio L.K., Bailey D.H., Zhou X., Fractions: The new frontier for theories of numerical development, Trends Cogn.

Developing a serious game is a complex task. To reduce this complexity, researchers focus on modeling and code generation tools. Nonetheless, they still fall behind when they try to fit all SG requirements or to cover different game genre within the currently suggested approaches. In our research, we propose a new modeling framework that ease the design and development process of serious game for assessment (SGA). This framework allows the pedagogue to define the game general structure using UML and the game logic using a new DSL language, which is easier and more accessible to non-technical experts. As a proof of concept, we show how two different games can be designed and developed using our framework. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Code generation; DSL; Logic; Score; Structure; UML; Xtend; Xtext","Computer circuits; Digital subscriber lines; DSL; Human computer interaction; Structure (composition); Code Generation; Logic; Score; Xtend; Xtext; Serious games","","","","","Agence Universitaire de la Francophonie, AUF","Acknowledgment.

Although various proofs of stealth assessment’s validity have been reported, its application is a complex, laborious, and time-consuming process. To bolster the applicability of stealth assessment in serious games; a generic stealth assessment tool (GSAT) has been proposed, which uses machine learning techniques to reason over competence constructs, player log data and assess player performance. Current study provides empirical validation of GSAT by applying it to a real-world game, the abcdeSIM game, which was designed to train medical care workers to act effectively medical emergency situations. GSAT demonstrated, while relying on a Gaussian Naive Bayes Network, to be highly robust and reliable, achieving a three-level assessment accuracy of 96%, as compared with a reference score model defined by experts. By this result, this study contributes to the alleviation of stealth assessment’s applicability issues and hence promotes its wider uptake by the serious game community. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","ABCDE-method; Generic tool; Machine learning; Serious games; Statistical model; Stealth assessment; Stepwise regression","Bayesian networks; Learning systems; Machine learning; ABCDE-method; Generic tools; Statistical modeling; Stealth assessment; Stepwise regression; Serious games","","","","","School of Health Professions Education, Maastricht University","We wish to thank IJsfontein, serious game company in Amsterdam, for making the game and extensive logging utility available and Virtual Medschool for providing (anonymised) game log data.

Crisis management training has benefited from the introduction of humanmachine interfaces (HMIs) and wearable monitoring sensors. Crisis responders are nowadays able to attend training sessions through computer-simulated crisis scenarios while simultaneously receiving realtime feedback on their operational and cognitive performance. Such training sessions would require a considerable amount of resources if they were to be recreated in the real world. We introduce Andromeda, a toolkit designed to allow remote-access, real-time crisis management training personalisation through an applied game. Andromeda consists of a browser-based dashboard which enables real-time monitoring and adaptation of crisis management scenarios, and a remote server which securely stores, analyses and serves training data. In this paper, we discuss Andromeda’s design concepts and propose future studies using this toolkit. Our main focal points are player stress response modelling and automated crisis management training adaptation. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Crisis management; Game-based training; Personalised games; Player monitoring; Real-time adaptation; Serious games","Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Cognitive performance; Crisis management; Game-based trainings; Human Machine Interface; Personalised games; Real time monitoring; Real-time adaptation; Technological advancement; Serious games","","","","","Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO","funded by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO).","Bacon L., Mackinnon L., Cesta A., Cortellessa G., Developing a smart environment for crisis management training, J.

This study explores the point of view of players on the relationship between digital games and learning, based on a set of semi-structured interviews and two workshops involving relevant stakeholder groups (players, teachers, trainee teachers, and parents). Analysis of the gathered qualitative and quantitative data reveals that both players and educators agree that games have educational potential, but the assumption of blanket learner enthusiasm for game based learning is not always accurate. In particular, players have some resistance towards serious games, which are seen as less appealing than “real” videogames. In addition, some players and some teachers feel that the use of games in formal learning contexts contradicts the fundamental freedom intrinsic to the act of playing. Players are aware of the risks video-gaming presents, but they do not appear to be fully aware of its learning potential, as most mention lower order skills (memory, attention, reaction time) rather than academic knowledge and soft skills. Some mention game potential for the development of their social, cultural and gender identity, with consequential positive effects on their ethical beliefs. Players also point out the importance of videogame education for teachers, parents and for themselves. Lastly, they feel the need for innovation in games that, through innovative game mechanics and narratives, enhances the cultural and artistic component of games. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Entertainment games; Formal learning; Game-based learning; Informal learning; Players’ attitudes; Serious games","E-learning; Interactive computer graphics; Educational potential; Entertainment games; Formal learning; Game-based Learning; Informal learning; Learning potential; Semi structured interviews; Stakeholder groups; Serious games","","","","","Horizon 2020 program2; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; Horizon 2020, (732332)","Funding text 1: The Gaming Horizon project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 732332.; Funding text 2: The study is based on qualitative and quantitative data collected in 2017 as part of Gaming Horizons, a European research project funded by the Horizon 2020 program2.

Recent advances in sensor technology allow for acquiring physiological data of players which, in turn, allows for acquiring more fine-grained information on internal changes of the player than conventional user interaction data. Therefore, the current pilot study assessed the feasibility of dynamic difficulty adjustment (DDA) in a digital game-based emergency personnel training using heart rate data. In particular, the game became harder/easier when learners heart rate fell below/exceeded predefined thresholds based on leaners individual baseline heart rate. For the adaptive version of the game, we observed that heart rate changes indeed triggered the game to become easier/more difficult. This also altered completion rates as compared to a non-adaptive version of the same game. Moreover, players reported the adaptive version to be more challenging, fascinating, and harder than the non-adaptive one. At the same time players felt that the difficulty in the adaptive version was just right, while the non-adaptive one was rated to be harder than just right. In sum, DDA using heart rate seems feasible. However, future studies need to determine effects on performance and user experience of such adjustments in more detail and different contexts. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Adaptation; Biofeedback; Game-based learning; Heart rate; Personalization; Physiological data; Serious games","Biofeedback; Personnel training; Serious games; User experience; Adaptation; Game-based Learning; Heart rates; Personalizations; Physiological data; Heart","","","","","","","Kiili K., Moeller K., Ninaus M., Evaluating the effectiveness of a game-based rational number training-in-game metrics as learning indicators, Comput.

In an effort to reinforce the active participation of learners in games, this paper presents a participatory process in which students and teachers are involved in game design. The proposed process concerns redesigning existing commercial games into educational ones and includes establishing the learning goals, identifying appropriate commercial games, adapting the rules and context, crafting and playtesting the game. Using language learning as one application of this process, the paper presents how three well-known tabletop games were redesigned in a foreign language classroom with elementary and intermediate English language learners. The benefits that underlie the process concern students’ active participation, boosting their problem-solving skills, and engaging them in creative learning. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Creativity in education; Game-based language learning; Participatory design; Student-centered pedagogies; Tabletop games","Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Creative-learning; English languages; Language learning; Participatory approach; Participatory design; Participatory process; Problem solving skills; Tabletop games; Students","","","","","","","Albion P., Project-, Problem-, and Inquiry-Based Learning.

In recent years, there is discussion on how valid evidence of SGs efficiency can be increased, in order to further promote their use. Thus, numerous SG design and evaluation frameworks have been introduced, many of which have proved useful for SGs developing teams. Despite this, however, for novice designers, this vast array can be daunting. The aim of the present paper is to combine well-known frameworks and extract the conceptual factors that need to be considered when designing an SG. Having in mind that the proposed aspects are not in their essence independent, a classification of these aspects is presented, along with suggestions regarding their use and the dependencies among them. Although the various frameworks might have many common factors, there are some that highlight specific aspects of a particular factor. For instance, those frameworks that apart from the descriptive factors provide aspects regarding application, measurement, and assessment. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Conceptual design; Framework; Serious games","Conceptual design; Common factors; Design and evaluations; Framework; Serious games","","","","","","","Fisch S., Making educational computer games educational, Proceedings of the 2005 Conference on Interaction Design and Children, pp. 56-61, (2005); Yusoff A., Crowder R., Gilbert L., Wills G., A conceptual framework for serious games, Ninth IEEE International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies (ICALT), pp. 21-23, (2009); de Freitas S., Jarvis S., A framework for developing serious games to meet learner needs, Interservice/Industry Training, Simulation, and Education Conference (I/ITSEC), Florida, (2006); Catalano E.C., Luccini M.A., Mortara M., Best practices for an effective design and evaluation of serious games, Int.

Nevertheless, research that considers the meaning of the User Interface (UI) in game-based learning has been sparse. This paper reports a within-subject study in which we investigated how the implementation of the UI affects students’ performance (accuracy), training efficiency (task completion duration), and user experience in a number line based math game. Ninety-three fifth graders played the same math game with three different UIs in a counter balanced order. The results revealed that the implementation of the UI influenced significantly on performance and training efficiency. Students’ estimation performance with the chair-based exertion UI (whole-body movement) was significantly worse than with the tilting UI (controlled with hands) and virtual directional pad UI (con-trolled with fingers). Nevertheless, the players felt that the controlling of the game was equally easy with the gaming chair than with the other two controlling methods. Actually, the majority of the students named the chair as the most preferable controlling method. The results suggest that a whole-body movement can be an engaging and viable controlling method for learning games, but its effects on performance and efficiency should be considered, especially in game-based assessment context. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Game-based learning; Human-computer interaction; Number line estimation; User experience; User interface; Whole-body movement","Efficiency; Estimation; Human computer interaction; Students; User experience; User interfaces; Assessment context; Controlling methods; Estimation performance; Game-based Learning; Learning effectiveness; Line estimation; Training efficiency; Whole body; Computer games","","","","","","","Devlin K., The music of math games, Am.

The quantity and veracity of the recorded data rely mainly on the motivation and engagement of each participant. However, for a non-botanist, tree mapping can be perceived as an unstructured and tedious task that requires advanced skills. In addition, existing GCI applications deliver poor or nonexistent feedbacks regarding identification and mapping skills as well as progression in these skills. Structuring GCI sessions and enhancing them with game mechanics and clear objectives may have a positive effect on the inventory quality. Inventory situations being highly context dependant, a descriptive model of the GCI task is required to create adapted activity scenarios usable in various situations. This paper presents Albiziapp: a web collaborative and mobile tool, based on OpenSteetMap, that operationalizes any gamified scenario, consistent with a descriptive model built from a structural analysis of the GCI task. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Collaborative inventory; Gamification; Tree mapping & learning","Forestry; Gamification; Citizen science; Collaborative inventory; Descriptive Model; Motivation and engagements; Tree mapping; Mapping","","","","","ANR-15-CE38-0004-01; French National Agency for Research; Agence Nationale de la Recherche, ANR","Funding text 1: The presented work is conducted as part of the ReVeRies project9 and is supported by the French National Agency for Research (ANR).

We collected information from potential users on some basic features about two types of games for improving the driver performance: driver games and passenger games. In a survey with 18 respondents, both the typologies have been considered appealing, with drivers more interested in assessing performance and having suggestions, passengers in having fun. The greatest difference involves the requirement that a driver game should avoid distraction. Thus, the set-up phase should be doable when the vehicle is stopped, the visual feedback, if any, should be very limited (e.g., color spots), and most of the feedback should be provided through the audio channel. Passenger games might have more complex plots, with chance factors, and also support social interaction, for instance with passengers of other vehicles. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Games and infotainment; Internet of things; Mobile computing; Serious games; Smart cars; Usability survey; User interfaces; Vehicle safety","Internet of things; Mobile computing; Surveys; User interfaces; Vehicles; Visual communication; Driver performance; Infotainment; Potential users; Smart car; Social interactions; Usability survey; Vehicle safety; Visual feedback; Serious games","","","","","","","Krome S., Walz S.P., Greuter S., Holopainen J., Gerlicher A., Schleehauf M., Exploring game ideas for stresslessness in the automotive domain, Proceedings of the 2014 Conference on Interactive Entertainment, (2014); Bellotti F., Et al., TEAM applications for collaborative road mobility, IEEE Trans.

The design is based on a guiding frame in line with the intrinsic integration theory, which states that in a game, learning goal and game goal should be aligned. This also results in an alignment between a pedagogical approach and game mechanics. Our findings suggest three guidelines within this guiding frame. First, the guiding frame works in a specific order starting with forming a learning goal and ending with the game goal. Also, to optimize the alignment between the learning goal and the game goal, it should only be possible for players to reach the game goal when the desired learning goal is reached. Finally, during the iterations of the design process the focus is on aligning the pedagogical approach with the game mechanics. This proved to be an essential but difficult step. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Educational game; Intrinsic integration; Newtonian mechanics","Design; Design process; Educational game; Frame-work; Learning goals; Newtonian mechanics; Pedagogical approach; Specific ordering; Mechanics","","","","","Ministerie van Onderwijs, Cultuur en Wetenschap, OCW, (OCW/PromoDoc/1065001)","Acknowledgements.

Understanding the differences between classical and quantum physics is difficult, especially for children, who cannot grasp the subtleties conveyed in complicated formulae. We propose to achieve this in a playful and immersive manner, which is a more familiar and convenient way to introduce children to new concepts. For this we developed Save Schrödinger’s Cat, a puzzle game in virtual reality featuring a classical physics mode and a quantum physics mode. As virtual objects and phenomena behave differently in each mode, this mechanic encourages players to toggle between modes, in order to explore the differences between quantum and classical physics in an immersive, entertaining and challenging way. A preliminary evaluation showed that players could better identify various distinguishing features of either mode. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Classical physics; Educational games; Quantum physics; Virtual reality","Classical physics; Educational game; Immersive; Naked-eye; Puzzle games; Quantum physics; Small scale; Virtual objects; Virtual reality","","","","","","","Ataman S., Vacuum birefringence detection in all-optical scenarios, Phys.

However, although it is central to resilient operations, decision-making in dynamic resource management is rarely visible to managers. Sometimes the identification of successful strategies is apparent only through adverse event reports. A simulation game could be helpful for the acquisition of non-technical skills in addressing operational conundrums that could threaten the defence ability of a paediatric emergency department under care production pressures. This contribution presents a Sandtable serious logistical game of the care production system and, in particular, proposes its scoring mechanism, which was tested in a set of logistical experiments. The results show that through gamification, participants were challenged in terms of their intrinsic self-interest when it came to approaching the work. More importantly, the proposed extrinsic reward system allows all parallel functional roles to be equally rewarded as the game evolves. Anticipatory human resource management is identified as a successful strategy for achieving a sustainable working environment if the organizational resilience is confronted with patient inflow surges during the busiest hours of the busiest day. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Decision making; Emergency department; Game design; Game mechanics; Performance outcomes; Resource management; Scoring system; Training","Emergency rooms; Human resource management; Natural resources management; Pediatrics; Personnel training; Resource allocation; Serious games; Emergency departments; Game design; Performance outcome; Resource management; Scoring systems; Decision making","","","","","","","Bragard I., Dupuis G., Fleet R., Quality of work life, burnout, and stress in emergency department physicians: A qualitative review, Eur.

In the current study, third-graders played the Number Trace Fractions prototype in which they estimated fraction locations and compared fraction magnitudes on a number line. The intervention consisted of five 30 min playing sessions. Conceptual fraction knowledge was assessed with a paper based pre- and posttest. Additionally, after the intervention students’ fraction comparison strategies were explored with game-based comparison tasks including self-explanation prompts. The results support previous findings indicating that game-based interventions emphasizing fraction magnitudes improve students’ performance in conceptual fraction tasks. Nevertheless, the results revealed that in spite of clear improvement many students tended to use false fraction magnitude comparison strategies after the intervention. It seems that the game mechanics and the feedback that the game provided did not support conceptual change processes of students with low prior knowledge well enough and common fraction misconceptions still existed. Based on these findings we further developed the game and extended it with physical manipulatives. The aim of this extension is to help students to overcome misconceptions about fraction magnitude by physically interacting with manipulatives. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Conceptual change; Fraction; Game-based learning; Manipulatives; Mathematics; Number line; Serious games","Mathematical techniques; Students; Conceptual change; Fraction; Game-based Learning; Manipulatives; Number line; Serious games","","","","","","","Hainey T., Connolly T.M., Boyle E.A., Wilson A., Razak A., A systematic literature review of games-based learning empirical evidence in primary education, Comput.

For example, they should be aware of the challenges of maintaining proper urban surface waters, so that they can take on a responsible and proactive role. Ideally, citizens should acquire this knowledge from an early age. We describe the design, implementation, and evaluation of the serious game Hydro Hero, aimed at forming and reinforcing this awareness and reasoning. Hydro Hero is an infinite runner game with extended minigames, which show both what should not be on the canals as well as why they should be removed. We assessed the ability of Hydro Hero to teach young children about canal maintenance by combining a questionnaire with open-ended play-testing sessions at a science museum. On average, players were able to improve their ability to justify why certain items should be removed or left in a canal. It has not been fully confirmed that Hydro Hero conveyed this specific knowledge, due to the absence of quizzing beforehand. However, given the high participants’ engagement, we consider the game to have contributed to their awareness about the importance of canal cleaning for a sustainable urban environment. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Behavior change; Educational games; Urban water","Ability testing; Canals; Hydraulic structures; Maintenance; Behavior change; Educational game; Science museum; Specific knowledge; Sustainable urban environments; Urban surface waters; Urban waters; Young children; Serious games","","","","","","","All A., Castellar E.P.N., van Looy J., Assessing the effectiveness of digital game-based learning: Best practices, Comput.

To design tasks that promote learning, findings from basic research and user data from earlier versions of the game can be very helpful. In the current study, we reanalysed data from two studies using a game-based assessment and a training tool for improving fraction magnitude knowledge. Similar to results from basic research, data of both studies indicated that performance in game-based versions of number line estimation and magnitude comparison were highly correlated (even after controlling for students’ overall math achievement). This suggests that both tasks share an underlying (spatial) representation of number magnitude. Based on this we designed a new task to improve fraction learning. In particular, we merged mechanics of number line estimation and magnitude comparison to consider shared processing of number magnitude in both tasks in our game-based learning of fractions. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","","Estimation; Data-driven design; Design tasks; Game-Based; Game-based Learning; Highly-correlated; Line estimation; Training tools; Value of games; Education","","","","","Leibniz-Competition Fund, (SAW-2016-IWM-3); Academy of Finland, (289140)","Acknowledgments.

We have chosen Diablo III and Trails of Cold Steel as benchmarks, and game refinement measure is employed for the assessment. It reveals that a reliable level up system is the key factor to make the players feel more exciting and adventurous. It then confirms the effectiveness of the proposed method which enables to numerically identify the components that need to be enhanced to improve the game and help creators design a more attractive game by the paradigmatic rules. Future works include the application of the proposed method in other domains such as serious games. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","Battle system; Game refinement theory; Level-up system; Role-playing-game; Weapon system","Computer science; Computers; Battle system; Level-up system; Refinement theory; Role-playing game; Weapon system; Artificial intelligence","","","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (26540189)","The authors wish to thank the anonymous referees for their constructive comments that helped to improve the article considerably.

The repository is designed as an asset life-cycle management system for defining, publishing, updating, searching and packaging for distribution of these assets. The RAGE repository provides storage space for assets and their artefacts. It will be embedded in a social platform for networking among asset developers and other users. A dedicated Asset Repository Manager provides the main functionality of the repository and its integration with other systems. Tools supporting the Asset Manager are presented and discussed.

However, their efficacy can be considered as being dependent on personal preferences of the recipients. In this exploratory study, two multiple choice question-based apps have been evaluated as a learning tool in a university course of an environmental engineering study program: a commercial quiz app (QuizUp) and a professional learning app (Skive). At the beginning of the course each student (N = 15) chose one of these apps as a mandatory learning aid for factual knowledge over the complete course period. The study results, collected by learning diaries, a questionnaire and results of the final test, confirm the type dependence of learning experiences created by these tools. Further, it acknowledges mostly the maturity of the used question-based learning app, but reveals current limitations of both, the quiz app and the didactical context. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Learning app; Mobile learning; Multiple choice question; Quiz app; QuizUp; Skive","Application programs; E-learning; Serious games; Students; Comparative studies; Exploratory studies; Learning experiences; Mobile Learning; Multiple choice questions; Professional learning; QuizUp; Skive; Education","","","","","","","Karpicke J.D., Roediger H.L., The critical importance of retrieval for learning, Science, 319, pp. 966-968, (2008); Agarwal P.K., Karpicke J.D., Kang S.H.K., Roediger H.L., McDermott K.B., Examining the testing effect with open- and closed-book tests, Appl.

Part of the challenges in this task stem from the fact that gamification represents a class of systems combining utilitarian and hedonic benefits. In addition, there is a lack of appropriate tools supporting gamification of learning. To bridge this gap, we developed OneUp, a course gamification platform. This paper examines the challenges associated with gamifying learning along with OneUp’s support for overcoming them. It also presents a preliminary study of the impact of utilitarian and hedonic values in the context of a gamified Data Structures course. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","","Computer science; Computers; Game elements; Gamification; Hedonic values; Holistic thinking; Learning experiences; Artificial intelligence","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1623236, 1821189, DUE-1821189); College of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics, Youngstown State University, STEM","Funding text 1: This material is based upon work funded by NSF Project 1623236 “TIP: Increasing Student Motivation and Engagement in STEM Courses through Gamification” and partially supported by NSF DUE-1821189 Project.; Funding text 2: Acknowledgments.

These deficits impact activities of daily living (ADL) and children’s independence. In addition, there is a substantial relationship between eye-hand coordination and the acquisition of literacy skills. In this paper, we present the design process of a gesture-based videogame to support eye-hand coordination and literacy skills. First, we conducted a contextual study in an educational institute for children with DS. Next, using the contextual study results, several design solutions were generated and iterated using low-fidelity prototypes. Finally, we designed and developed BeeSmart, a videogame based on the Troncoso’s method for literacy, wherein children use their fingers to draw around pictograms and words on a screen. Finally, we present a usability evaluation of BeeSmart to show the potential for supporting children with DS. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Down syndrome; Eye-hand coordination; Literacy; Videogame","Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Activities of Daily Living; Design solutions; Down syndrome; Educational Institutes; Eye-hand coordination; Literacy; Usability evaluation; Videogame; Education","","","","","","","Davis A.S., Children with down syndrome: Implications for assessment and intervention in the school, Sch.

But, teaching children with developmental disabilities like ASD, requires special set of tools and methods, due to decreased level of attention towards stimuli presented and lessened capability to learn in ways typical children do. Interactive multisensory computer based instruction seems to be a good match for these diverse learners because it offers multisensory learning experience, interactive practice with constant feedback, increased learning opportunities, and customization to each child’s needs. In this paper we present a web-based interactive educational e-book designed to engage a learner with additional auditoryvisual stimulation related to the text being read in two languages, and by providing multi layered questions about the story read, for comprehension. Our educational goals were to teach children novel vocabulary, counting, identifying numbers and colors, and responding to inference questions. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Autism; Children; Education; Interactive e-book; Learn unit","Diseases; Education; Electronic publishing; Autism; Children; Children with autisms; Computer based instruction; Developmental disability; E-books; Learn unit; Multi-sensory learning; E-learning","","","","","UNICEF-BH","The authors would like to thank employees of the non-for-profit organization EDUS-Education for All.

The game jam followed a four-phased structure over the course of four days. Forty-five participants shared their demographics, baseline competency, attitude towards game jams, and learning expectations in a pre-jam questionnaire. In a post-jam questionnaire they assessed their collaboration and learning outcomes. Results are generally positive, although some measures of collaboration constructs were unreliable. Nevertheless, a game jam is in principal a format worthy of introduction into formal game design and development education. Several implications and next steps are discussed. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","","Curricula; Formal games; Game design; Learning outcome; Netherlands; Surveys","","","","","","","Fowler A., Khosmood F., Arya A., Lai G., The global game jam for teaching and learning, Proceedings of the 4Th Annual Conference on Computing and Information Technology Research and Education New Zealand, pp. 28-34, (2013); Farhan E., Kocher M., Big team game jams: A framework to emulate big production using game jams with big teams, International Conference on Game Jams, Hackathons, and Game Creation Events, Berkeley, CA, pp. 1-7, (2016); Fowler A., Lai G., Studios K., Khosmood F., Trends in organizing philosophies of game jams and game hackathons, Workshop on Game Jams, Hackathons and Game Creation Events, Pacific Grove, CA, USA, (2015); Kultima A., Alha K., Nummenmaa T., Design constraints in game design case: Survival mode game jam 2016, International Conference on Game Jams, Hackathons, and Game Creation Events, pp. 22-29, (2016); Locke R., Parker L., Galloway D., Sloan R., The game jam movement: Disruption, performance and artwork, Workshop Proceedings of the 10Th International Conference on the Foundations of Digital Games (Pacific Grove, California, Asilomar Conference Grounds), Pacific Grove, CA, USA, (2015); Pirker J., Voll K., Group forming processes-experiences and best practice from different game jams, Workshop on Game Jams, Hackathons and Game Creation Events, Pacific Grove, CA, USA, (2015); Preston J.A., Chastine J., O'Donnell C., Tseng T., Macintyre B., Game jams: Community, motivations, and learning among jammers, Int.

To optimize especially airport processes, cooperation between the above mentioned stakeholders is mandatory, but divergent goals and interests are supposed to have an influence on their decision-making process. Because of this, the way of collaborative decision-making seems to be a challenge. The aspects of human interactions during negotiations and human performance in planning activities are difficult to measure with conventional methods of realand fast-time simulations. Serious Gaming is a new method in this research field to validate interaction processes in Air Traffic Management. The serious multiplayer game “D-CITE” (Decisions based on Collaborative Interactions in TEams) was developed to specifically analyze underlying factors that drive decision-making processes in an airport management environment. The aim of this paper is to illustrate the main ideas of D-CITE as well as to discuss the aspect of collaborative learning. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","","Air traffic control; Air transportation; Airport vehicular traffic; Airports; Aviation; Concrete pavements; Distributed computer systems; Human resource management; Traffic control; Air traffic controller; Air Traffic Management; Collaborative decision making; Collaborative interaction; Collaborative learning; Conventional methods; Decision making process; Fast-time simulation; Decision making","","","","","","","Gunther Y., Inard A., Werther B., Bonnier M., Spies G., Marsden A., Niederstrasser H., Et al., Total Airport Management, (2006); (2006); Jipp M., Depenbrock F.S., Suikat R., Schaper M., Papenfuss A., Kaltenhauser S., Weber B., Validation of multi-objective optimization for total airport management, Proceedings of the 8Th Asian Control Conference (ASCC), Kaohsiung, Taiwan, (2011); Schmalz J.S., Zwischen Kooperation Und Kollaboration, Zwischen Hierarchie Und Heterarchie, (2007); Meinecke M., Suikat R., Evaluation of total airport management concepts via a game-based approach, 30Th European Annual Conference on Human Decision-Making and Manual Control (EAM), Baunschweig, Germany, (2012); Freese M., Drees S., Meinecke M., Between game and reality: Using serious games to analyze complex interaction processes in air traffic management, Proceedings of the 46Th ISAGA Conference, Kyoto; Romero M., Usart M., Ott M., Earp J., De Freitas S., Learning through playing for or against each other?

The outstanding point of this model is the simplicity. It can be used as a basis model to create a new emotional AI in other domains such as education and psychology. It proposes a notion of emotional component which contains three main factors: personality, memory and mood. All three factors are interrelated and may affect the decision making. For the assessment, a real-time fighting game is used where the proposed model is implemented. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed idea that only three simple factors are enough to show the emotion. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","Emotional AI; Mood; Personality","Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Fighting games; Generic modeling; Mood; Multiplayers; Personality; Real time; Decision making","","","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS, (26540189)","","Egges A., Kshirsagar S., Magnenat-Thalmann N., A Model for Personality and Emotion Simulation, 2773, pp. 453-461, (2003); Atkinson R.C., Shiffrin R.M., Human memory: A proposed system and its control processes, Psychol.

The core principle is for the player to alternate between two modes: selecting candidate capabilities with a game theoretic limiting pressure, and executing a simulated mission using those selections in a virtual environment. Alternating between the two modes allows us to collect quantitative data on performance and preferences, improve the trustworthiness of qualitative feedback, and increase the chance of discovering novel uses. We report on preliminary results from applying the HIVELET in a military context. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Experimental results; Gamification; Requirements analysis; Technology evaluation","Game theory; Emerging technologies; Evaluation of technology; Experimental results; Gamification; Qualitative feedback; Requirements analysis; Technology evaluation; Virtual experimentations; Virtual reality","","","","","","","Dixon A., Henning J., Nett Warrior Gets New End-User Device, (2013); Hern A., US marines reject BigDog robotic packhorse because it’s too noisy, The Guardian, (2015); Klein G., Sources of Power: How People Make Decisions, (1998); Terwiesch C., Ulrich K.T., Innovation Tournaments: Creating and Selecting Exceptional Opportunities, (2009); Allen G., Chan T., Artificial Intelligence and National Security.

It lacks systematic studies assessing its effect in different contexts. Creating a gamified course is still time-consuming and design limited. As a response to these challenges, we developed OneUp Learning – a customizable platform aimed at facilitating the process of gamifying learning activities and enabling contextual studies. In this paper we present the platform architecture and its functionality, which includes support for integrating game design elements in learning activities, for creation of dynamic problems and for visualizing student performance and progress. At the end, we present a usability study of the platform and the assessment results from an end user perspective. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","","Curricula; Customizable platforms; Dynamic problem; End-user perspective; Learning Activity; Platform architecture; Student performance; Systematic study; Usability studies; Education","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (1623236, HRD 1623236)","Funding text 1: This material is based upon work supported by the NSF project HRD 1623236 “TIP: Increasing Student Motivation and Engagement in STEM Courses through Gamification.” We thank Dr. Jurek Kirakowski for being gracious enough to grant us an academic license for SUMI.; Funding text 2: Game Elements Supported by the Platform","Hamari J., Koivisto J., Sarsa H., Does gamification work?–a literature review of empirical studies on gamification, 47Th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, pp. 3025-3034, (2014); Seaborn K., Fels D.I., Gamification in theory and action: A survey, Int.

Cognitive decline is usually measured by tests of mental processing, however age-related changes in sleep may also reveal signs of cognitive decline among older individuals. The current work presents and evaluates a gaming system for cognitive screening and sleep duration assessment of the elderly. The gaming system consists of an original serious game for cognitive screening (Smartkuber) and a smartwatch (Basis Peak). A pilot study is conducted to identify and improve the weaknesses of the gaming system and to evaluate the gaming system as to its usability and the game experience it offers for elderly players, assesing its suitability for a large-scale study. The pilot study lasted for 6weeks and 101 gaming sessions were recorded from 5 elderly players. Elderly players were entertained by the game, while they were impressed by the smartwatch’s performance. Limitations of the study and future directions are discussed. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","Cognitive screening; Serious games; Smartwatch","Wearable computers; Age-related changes; Cognitive decline; Cognitive screenings; Game experience; Gaming systems; Large-scale studies; Serious games; Smartwatch; Sleep research","","","","","","","An C., Yu L., Wang L., Jin G., Song M., Zhu Q., Jia H., Liu K., Wang M., Wang X., Association between sleep characteristics and mild cognitive impairment in elderly people, Neurophysiology, 46, 1, pp. 88-94, (2014); Bangor A., Kortum P.T., Miller J.T., An empirical evaluation of the system usability scale, Int.

As such, CT as a cognitive ability builds on concepts and processes that derive from computer programming, but are applicable to wider real-life problems and STEM domains. CT has recently been argued to be a fundamental skill for 21                             st                              century education and an early academic success indicator that should be introduced and trained already in primary school education. Accordingly, we developed three life-size board games – Crabs & Turtles: A Series of Computational Adventures – that aim at providing an unplugged, gamified and low-threshold introduction to CT by presenting basic coding concepts and computational thinking processes to 8 to 9-year-old primary school children. For the design and development of these educational board games we followed a rapid prototyping approach. In the current study, we report results of an empirical evaluation of game experience of our educational board games with students of the target age group. In particular, we conducted quantitative analyses of player experience of primary school student participants. Results indicate overall positive game experience for all three board games. Future studies are planned to further evaluate learning outcomes in educational interventions with children.                          © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Board games; Computational thinking; Unplugged activities","Computation theory; Computer games; Computer programming; Algorithmic thinking; Board games; Computational thinkings; Design and Development; Educational intervention; Empirical evaluations; Primary school children; Unplugged activities; Students","","","","","","","Wing J.M., Computational Thinking, Theor.

Nevertheless, serious games are still facing crucial challenges, such as their integration in the global learning process. On the other hand, with the increased adoption of online applications and courses, it is becoming possible to collect and centralize large amounts of trace data generated by players. Such data may be used to produce statistics on students’ behaviors inside pedagogical serious games, both as individuals and aggregated as groups (e.g., classrooms). In this paper we propose a classification of potential uses of statistics in serious games and give new insights into how statistical analysis of groups’ behavior may impact positively on the learning process. We also present experimental results obtained during a large-scale game deployment using the Wegas platform, our open source platform for game authoring and execution. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","Classroom orchestration; Comparative behavior analysis; Competency management; Deep learning; Learning analytics; Serious games; Statistics; Teacher empowerment","Education; Learning systems; Statistics; Students; Behavior analysis; Classroom orchestration; Competency managements; Deep learning; Learning analytics; Serious games; Teacher empowerment; Teaching","","","","","","","Arnab S., Et al., Towards performance prediction using in-game measures, Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the American Educational Research Association, Chicago, USA, (2015); Arnold K.E., Signals: Applying academic analytics, EDUCAUSE Q, 33, (2010); Bloom B.S., Et al., Taxonomy of Educational Objectives: The Classification of Educational Goals, (1956); Boyle E.A., Connolly T.M., Hainey T., The role of psychology in understanding the impact of computer game, Entertain.

The development of such a model, including its elementary components, their relations and calculation rules, is a demanding, costly and fault-prone task. This task becomes even more complex if very realistic models are required, as it is mostly the case for serious games. Alternatively, proven simulation software can be integrated into the serious game, turning the game into an easy to use and motivating user interface, and the simulation program into a verified processing unit. In this article, we present a serious game dealing with water infrastructure planning, which interfaces to an engineering simulation software for necessary calculations. After motivating the combination of game and simulation software in this special case of water infrastructure planning, we focus on the characteristics of the software architecture and the development process. Data availability and data aggregation are identified as issues central to a successful implementation of the presented architecture. This case study thus reveals advantages and challenges of serious games employing service-oriented architectures (SOA). © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","Engineering software; Rating system; Serious game; Service oriented architecture; Transition path; Water infrastructure","Computer software; Information services; Motivation; User interfaces; Engineering software; Rating system; Serious games; Transition paths; Water infrastructure; Service oriented architecture (SOA)","","","","","Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF, (FKZ 033W011E)","The activities described in this article have been supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) under the grant agreement FKZ 033W011E.

In German middle school career choice is part of the curricula to introduce different career options and, at best, providing individual advice. Unfortunately, career choices of girls are still influenced by missing confidence in their abilities, role conflicts as well as resistant discrimination and harassment in the technology field [3, 11]. Women are also still underrepresented in the game industry, however, the number of female players is constantly rising [7]. Considering this, serious games seem to be a promising approach for girls to learn about career choice. The following paper will combine career choice findings and game design to present the German serious game “Serena Supergreen and the Broken Blade” - a point-and-click adventure aiming at promoting girl’s self-concept and interest in technology associated tasks. Results of a qualitative content analysis concerning girl’s perception of the game will be presented. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Career choice; Girls; Serious games","Education computing; Human computer interaction; Career choice; Career options; Content analysis; Female players; Gender differences; Girls; Innovative approaches; Technology fields; Serious games","","","","","","","Boyle E.A., Et al., An update to the systematic literature review of empirical evidence of the impacts and outcomes of computer games and serious games, Comput.

For this purpose, we designed and developed a game called LeapBalancer, and evaluated it with a group of kinesthetic and a group of non-kinesthetic players. The results of the evaluation show that considering the intelligences of the players during game design matters and affects their game experience. In addition, we analyzed the players’ in-game behavior to explain the results. The finding are also important for learning games, since research suggest that good game experience is positively correlated with improved learning. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","","Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Game design; Game experience; Learning game; Multiple intelligences; nocv1; Computer games","","","","","","","Millis K., Forsyth C., Butler H., Wallace P., Graesser A., Halpern D., Operation ARIES!: A serious game for teaching scientific inquiry, Serious Games and Edutainment Applications, pp. 169-195, (2011); Poels K., De Kort Y., Ijsselsteijn W., It is always a lot of fun!’: Exploring dimensions of digital game experience using focus group methodology, Proceedings of the 2007 Conference on Future Play, pp. 83-89, (2007); Csikszentmihalyi M., Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience, (1991); Webster J., Trevino L.K., Ryan L., The dimensionality and correlates of flow in human-computer interactions, Comput.

Pilots of the older generation often have experience with manually flying multiple types of aircraft and handling all kinds of incidents. In contrast, the future generation of pilots will not be given the chance to gain the experiences in practice. Consequently, they may not have the competencies needed to handle critical situations. This paper describes how we set about designing a serious game for the acquisition of the essential competencies for critical situations. The game offers meaningful events, which match situations that pilots can face someday. The events trigger and reinforce the competencies of situational awareness, workload management, and application of procedures. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Aviation; Competencies; Critical situations; Meaningful events; Serious games; Zero-fidelity simulation","Aircraft accidents; Aviation; Education; Training aircraft; Competencies; Critical situations; Future generations; Increased safety; Meaningful events; Situational awareness; Workload management; Zero-fidelity simulations; Serious games","","","","","","","Collins S., Safer Skies, Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty, 1, pp. 22-24, (2015); Stepniczka I., Tomova L., Rankin A., Woltjer R., Sladky R., Tik M., D3.1 Final Analysis of Research Evaluation, Man4gen Consortium, (2015); Rankin A., Woltjer R., Field J., Woods D., Staying ahead of the aircraft and Managing Surprise in Modern Airliners, Paper Presented at 5Th Resilience Engineering Symposium: Managing Trade-Offs, (2013); European Cockpit Association: Pilot Training Compass: Back to the Future, (2013); Franks P., Hay S., Mavin T., Can competency-based training fly?

However, in order to fully leverage those capabilities, game designers have to carefully balance factors that provide an enjoyable experience, without losing the focus on the instructional aspect. This work examines the design and evaluation of educational games focusing on the perspective of individual player emotions and experience. This investigation targets the following research questions: how to include (and balance) both the educational and the player experience elements into the game design? Which specific methodologies are available to evaluate player experience in educational games? After discussing possible answers to these questions, we briefly sketch directions that demand further research. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Educational games; Player experience; Serious game design; Serious game evaluation","Education; Education computing; Design and evaluations; Educational game; Game design; Game designers; Game evaluations; Learning experiences; Player experience; Research questions; Serious games","","","","","","","Blikstein P., Worsley M., Multimodal learning analytics and education data mining: Using computational technologies to measure complex learning tasks, J.

Neuroscience has developed many theories of learning, based on how brain learns. We discuss a design approach for conventional teaching methods. The proposed approach illustrates the opportunities to exploit the concept of neuroscience and combine it with game for educational purpose. The pedagogies based on neuroscience and psychology have been adapted in teaching very well and the same is expected to work well with Game Based Learning (GBL). © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","","Teaching; Design approaches; Game-based Learning; Teaching methods; Theories of learning; Neurology","","","","","","","Prensky M., Engage me or enrage me, Educ.

However, while in recent years interest in it has been growing, empirical evidence on the effects that the application of game elements can generate on users’ behaviour is still lacking. We present the results of a study as a step towards designing gamification with better understanding of the possible effects that each game element could generate on end users. By involving three groups of experts: game designers, learning scientists and specialists in technology-enhanced learning (TEL), we assessed a selected number of 21 game design patterns in relation to the effects these could generate on learning performance, goal achievement and engagement of learners if implemented in a Massive Online Open Course (MOOC). Based on quantitative and qualitative data collected, 9 game elements have been selected to be further investigated. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","","Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Design strategies; Game design; Game designers; Game elements; Gamification; Learning performance; Qualitative data; Technology enhanced learning; Curricula","","","","","European Commission, EC","Acknowledgements.

The present study aims at providing evidence for the validity of a serious game used for studying students’ conceptual knowledge of fractions. A total of 54 Finnish fifth graders played the math game on tablet computers using tilt-control to maneuver an avatar along a number line for a total of 30 min. Results indicated that most of the hallmark effects of fraction magnitude processing as identified in basic research on numerical cognition were successfully replicated using our serious game. This clearly suggests that game-based approaches for fraction education (even using tilt-control) are possible and may be effective tools for assessing and possibly promoting students’ conceptual knowledge of fractions. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","","Education computing; Students; Conceptual knowledge; Effective tool; Fifth graders; Finnish; Game-based approaches; Numerical cognition; Tablet computer; Tilt control; Serious games","","","","","Leibniz-Competition Fund, (SAW-2016-IWM-3); Academy of Finland","The current research was supported by the Leibniz-Competition Fund (SAW) supporting Manuel Ninaus (SAW-2016-IWM-3) and Academy of Finland supporting Kristian Kiili.","Bailey D.H., Et al., Competence with fractions predicts gains in mathematics achievement, J.

But often, decision makers do not follow the forecast. This behavior is only desirable in situations when the forecast is faulty or does not consider all information. Otherwise, it bears suboptimal decisions. This paper investigates under which circumstances decision makers rely on or discard forecasts. In particular, the degree of uncertainty is in the focus. Results show that the more uncertain the decision situation is, the more a decision maker relies on the forecast if it contradicts his own estimation. The more the situation seems to be clear, the more he relies on his own estimation.

When the literature examined, it was seen that traditional games contribute children character development, as well as linguistic and communicative development. When children allowed to play outdoor and/or traditional games, they explore the nature, learn democratic behaviors, acquire creative and critical thinking skills, learn how to communicate politely with others, develop muscle strength and coordination, learn sharing and caring, and obtain problems solving skills and self-confidence. In other words, playing traditional games supports the overall development of mind and body of a children. However, nowadays, many children spend too much time indoors, by playing online games, and/or sitting in front of a screen (e.g. television, tablet pc, or smart phone). In contrast to traditional games, online games do not include social interaction. In this study, the significance of game was clarified, and both positive and negative effects of gamification was demonstrated. Consequently, the aim of this study to generate a theoretical framework that display an understanding of theories and concepts that are relevant to the place and importance of games on children’s world and disclose a critical perspective about playing games in digital world. Therefore, relevant research studies for theories and analytic models were reviewed and interpreted in order to present two sides of gamification and highlight the importance of games. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","Contactless games; Digital games; Importance of games; Loose of contact; Play; Traditional games","Education; Personal computers; Smartphones; Social networking (online); Contact less; Digital games; Importance of games; Play; Traditional games; Game theory","","","","","","","Fleer M., Universal fantasy: The domination of Western theories of play, Child’s Play: Revisiting Play in Early Childhood Settings, pp. 67-80, (1999); Carr H.H., The survival value of play, Investigation of the Department of Psychology and Education: University of Colorado, (1902); F.: 1-3 Yas donemindeki cocugun oyun ve oyuncak ozelliklerinin gelisim kuramlari ile aciklanmasi.

The prototypes can be easily implemented by exploiting new open source electronic hardware technologies, such as Arduino and related sensors and actuators, combing simplicity, wide diffusion and low cost. Two simple proof of concepts are presented. First, a music game, in which children collaborate to create a melody composed by different sounds controllable by changing the hand’s distance in a theremin-like approach. The second project intends addressing the concepts of distance and alignment. In both cases, they are not closed-box fully automatic games, but tools freely usable by an educator (e.g., a teacher or a parent) with children. The experience shows that several alternative configurations are easily implemented, calling for the possibility of developing a hardware/software component library for development/assembly of various types of tangible games also by non experts. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","","Hardware; Open systems; Teaching; Alternative configurations; Basic mathematics; Electronic hardwares; Hardware/software components; Proof of concept; Sensors and actuators; Serious games; Wide diffusion; Education","","","","","","","Kiili K.J.M., Devlin K., Multisilta J., Editorial: Is game-based math learning finally coming of age?, Intl.

We used observations, questionnaires, and interviews to study how the 700+ audience were facilitated to experientially learn about the show’s main themes: compassion and collaboration. This case study contributed to our understanding how performance art may improve games for learning and training purposes, many of which now are notoriously ‘boring’. We concluded that performance art’s main contribution, in particular to games discussing fundamental values such as compassion, is to captivate players and ‘lure’ them into their natural behaviour. Thus the Parsifal game opera emotionally confronted its audience with their – callous and selfish – behaviour and intensified their learning through embodied experiences. However, some players lacked time and support to (collectively) reflect on their experiences and lacked catharsis. Therefore, we recommend using gameful performance art for learning and training purposes, provided that all activities in experiential learning are sufficiently facilitated. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","Experiential learning; Game-based learning; Informal learning; Interactive drama; Performance arts; Professional training; Real-life games","Personnel training; Experiential learning; Game-based Learning; Informal learning; Interactive drama; Performance arts; Professional training; Real-life games; Surveys","","","","","","","Boggs J.G., Mickel A.E., Holtom B.C., Experiential learning through interactive drama: An alternative to student role plays, J.

While this is true for all forms of education, it is particularly vital for business education curricula, and here it is sorely lacking. The main problem is that teachers lack the methods to teach sustainability competences. Gaming is proposed as a suitable method, as it involves action, direct feedback and high motivation. In this research we used a pre-post tests research set up to measure the learning effects from three simulation games. These games were played with 160 2nd year business students. We conclude that simulation games have limited contribution to cognitive learning about SD. However, a majority of respondents see additional value of gaming within their education. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","","Curricula; Students; Sustainable development; Teaching; Business educations; Cognitive learning; Competence development; Learning effects; Post test; Serious games; Simulation games; Education","","","","","","","United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (2004–2015): Draft International Implementation Scheme, (2005); Starkey K., Hatchuel A., Tempest S., Rethinking the business school: A European perspective, J.

The learning disorder afffects educational, personal, and social development of children in a negative way. Mobile serious games have the potential to support dyslexic primary-school children in addition to school support and learning therapy. We propose such a mobile serious game called “Prosodiya”, with the help of which dyslexic children can improve their reading and writing performance. Prosodiya includes innovative and evidence-based interventions that focus on improving the awareness of linguistic features related to syllable stress. We report the results of a pilot study of a preliminary version of the game. Results indicate that the children enjoyed playing the game, that their motivation was maintained, and that they wanted more levels. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","","Education; Linguistics; Developmental dyslexia; Evidence-based; Linguistic features; Mobile games; Pilot studies; Primary school children; Social development; Writing performance; Serious games","","","","","","","Beddington J., Cooper C.L., Goswami U., Huppert F.A., Jenkins R., Jones H.S., Tom B.L., Sahakian B.J., Thomas M., Field J., Goswami U., Huppert F.A., Jenkins R., Jones H.S., Kirkwood T.B.L., Sahakian B.J., Thomas S.M., The mental wealth of nations, Nature, 455, 7216, pp. 1057-1060, (2008); Bender F., Brandelik K., Jeske K., Lipka M., Loffler C., Mannhaupt G., Naumann C.L., Nolte M., Ricken G., Rosin H., Scheerer-Neumann G., Von Aster M., Von Orloff M., Die integrative Lerntherapie, Lernen Und Lernstörungen, 6, 2, pp. 65-73, (2017); Berkling K., Faller H., Piertzik M., Avoiding failure in modern game design with academic content - a recipe, an anti-pattern and applications thereof, Proceedings of the 9Th International Conference on Computer Supported Education, pp. 25-36, (2017); Berkling K., Pflaumer N., Lavalley R., German phonics game using speech synthesis - a longitudinal study about the effect on orthography skills, Workshop on Spoken Language Technology for Education (Slate), pp. 167-172, (2015); Boyle E.A., Hainey T., Connolly T.M., Gray G., Earp J., Ott M., Lim T., Ninaus M., Ribeiro C., Pereira J., An update to the systematic literature review of empirical evidence of the impacts and outcomes of computer games and serious games, Comput.

Usually, the effect of gamification alone is not sufficient to achieve sustainable self-directed occupation of students with digital learning tools. This statement is also confirmed by the authors’ experiences from previous uses of quiz apps to impart factual knowledge. The presented study describes the use of gamification in a university course in Urban Water Management in a twofold approach. The first approach of gamification is a gamified quiz app, which offers matches as well as ranking lists and competitions. The second approach is the gamified integration of the quiz app into the didactic context. The didactic context is characterized by the voluntary use of the quiz app and meaningful incentives, such as substitution of preliminary assessment tests. Compared to previous experiences, students showed a high level of engagement. Research instruments are the usage data of the quiz app and data collection at four points in time with the help of standardized measurement instruments (QCM, EGameFlow, and expectation-value model). The results include outstanding engagement of students indicated by an average of 2,223 questions per student answered during the semester, a high degree of confidence in mastering learning tasks among students, and a comparatively high level of knowledge improvement and social interaction reported by students. Overall, the study demonstrates the huge impact of deep gamification by integrating gamification into the didactic context and encourages further systematic research of deep gamification of didactic contexts. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Deep gamification; Higher education; Instructional design; Quiz app","Education computing; Students; Water management; Degree of confidence; Gamification; Higher education; Higher engineering educations; Instructional designs; Preliminary assessment; Standardized measurement; Urban water management; E-learning","","","","","","","Deterding S., Dixon D., Khaled R., Nacke L., From game design elements to gamefulness: Defining gamification, Proceedings of the 15Th International Academic Mindtrek Conference: Envisioning Future Media Environments, pp. 9-15, (2011); Hanus M.D., Cruz C., Leveling up the classroom, Gamification in Education, pp. 583-610; Marczewski A., Defining Gamification – What Do People Really Think?; Santos P.A., Deep gamification of a university course, Conference Proceedings Scitecin 2015 Sciences and Technologies of Interaction 12–13 November 2015 Coimbra, Portugal, (2015); Marczewski A., Thin Layer Vs Deep Level Gamification; Lees-Czerkawski C., Applying Game Design to a Medical Study Aid; Bellotti F., Et al., A gamified short course for promoting entrepreneurship among ICT engineering students, Proceedings-2013 IEEE 13Th International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies.

Between the techniques being applied by instructors to counteract this fact, we can find gamification techniques. Unfortunately, sometimes the result is the appearance of unwanted effects, which is a very common symptom of poor designs caused by the lack of proven methodologies for its purpose. This paper presents our first approach of a conceptual framework for designing the gamification of learning experiences. It is focused in higher education and based on the use of the Agile methodologies in order to obtain a fast Minimum Viable Product (MVP) ready for testing. Its aims are to apply different techniques all the way down to the lowest levels of abstraction through its step-by-step process. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Design; Framework; Gamification; Higher education; Learning","Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Design; Agile Methodologies; Conceptual frameworks; Framework; Gamification; Higher education; Learning; Learning experiences; Levels of abstraction; Education","","","","","Generalitat de Catalunya, (2014-DI-006, TIN2013–45303-P); Generalitat de Catalunya; Agència de Gestió d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca, AGAUR","This work was partly funded by Agència de Gestió d’Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca (Generalitat de Catalunya) through the Industrial Doctorate programme 2014-DI-006 and the Spanish Government by means of the project TIN2013–45303-P “ICT-FLAG” (Enhancing ICT education through Formative assessment, Learning Analytics and Gamification).

However, little is known about the impact of feedback design. Therefore, we investigated the effects of traditional two-dimensional and three-dimensional virtual reality based feedback modules on training performance and user experience in stroke patients. Neurofeedback performance was comparable between conditions. Interest, perceived feeling of control, and motivation were higher in patients using the virtual reality application compared to the two-dimensional feedback condition. In contrary, patients who performed the virtual reality training showed higher values in incompetence fear and lower values in mastery confidence compared to the traditional training group. These results indicate that neurofeedback can be improved with the implementation of virtual reality scenarios, especially with regard to patients’ interest and motivation. However, stroke patients might be more skeptical concerning virtual reality technique and less self-confident in using it. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","","Brain; Electronic medical equipment; Feedback; Motivation; 3D virtual reality; Feed-back designs; Healthy individuals; Neurological patient; Stroke patients; User experience; Virtual reality techniques; Virtual reality training; Virtual reality","","","","","BioTechMed-Graz","This work was partially supported by the European STREP Program – Collaborative Project no.

Drawing on findings from two pilot studies (N = 18, 25) and field notes from an ongoing empirical study (N = 140), we have identified three key challenges: reliability of measurement of attitudes, standardization of game experience for each participant, and measurement of attitudes toward socially sensitive topics. In this paper, we outline our research design that tried to address these challenges. In particular, we propose modifying the game, used as a research tool, to maintain player agency while ensuring all players engage with the measured phenomena. We also recommend using the concept of attitude strength in order to measure effectively attitudes toward socially sensitive topics. Overall, this paper provides preliminary insight into research on video games and attitude change within the field of digital game-based learning. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Attitude change; Czechoslovakia 38–89: Borderlands; Explicit and implicit attitudes; Representation of history; Serious game","Interactive computer graphics; Serious games; Attitude change; Czechoslovakia; Digital game-based learning; Empirical studies; Game experience; Implicit attitudes; Research designs; Research tools; Human computer interaction","","","","","Univerzita Karlova v Praze, UK, (FF/VG/2017/115); European Regional Development Fund, FEDER;AN:ERDF","Acknowledgments.

However, while the literature reports that a gamification design relying on external motivation only can lead users to cognitive dissonance, most gamification approaches use points, badges and leaderboards as dominant game elements. We present our developed testable predictions with the aim of investigating additional motivational theories (flow and persuasion) to argue for a deeper integration of gamification and the learning content at hand. Relying on expert selected game elements, we consequently derive design considerations to create gMOOCs, gamified massive online open courses, designed according to the principles of flow and persuasion. Our findings are the basis of our experiment and a contribution to the development of a new theoretical design for gamification. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Design; Flow; Game elements; Gamification; MOOC; Persuasion","Curricula; Design; Flow; Game elements; Gamification; MOOC; Persuasion; Education","","","","","","","Hoflinger P.J., Zimmerling E., Monitoring gamification in international patent documents: Technology classes, firms and preliminary value indicators, 2016 49Th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS), pp. 1319-1327, (2016); Antonaci A., Klemke R., Stracke C.M., Specht M., Gamification in MOOCs to enhance users’ goal achievement, Proceedings of IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON 2017), pp. 25-28, (2017); Cook S., Bingham T., Reid S., Wang L., Going Massive: Learner Engagement in a MOOC Environment, (2015); Christy K.R., Fox J., Leaderboards in a virtual classroom: A test of stereotype threat and social comparison explanations for women’s math performance, Comput.

The portal aims at fostering collaborations and the exchange of technical artefacts and associated knowledge and resources between different stakeholders in the field of serious gaming (e.g. educators, developers, researchers, publishers, policy makers and end-users). After a brief introduction to the H2020 RAGE project, the flexible design of the marketplace portal and its underlying software repository are presented. A concise overview is given of the initial set of advanced game technology components created by RAGE, that are currently exposed in the portal. For empirical validation of these components, we have developed 7 serious games based on subsets of these components, which were then tested in educational practice with several hundreds of end-users. This game components portal want to be a neutral hub not dependent on any technology or provider and therefore it is open for new game technologies submissions. We envision this marketplace as a knowledge and game technologies hub to support and amplify serious game development. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Education; Learning; Learning technology; Marketplace; Serious games; Software components","Commerce; Education; Engineering education; Knowledge management; Software design; Empirical validation; Game technologies; Learning; Learning technology; Marketplace; Serious game development; Software component; Software repositories; Serious games","","","","","EC H2020; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (644187); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; European Commission, EC","Funding text 1: Acknowledgement.

To encourage a greater discussion on the potential benefits and challenges of a more holistic approach to developing GBL, that promote human centred interactions and play for learning, the authors present the Game Changers initiative. The Game Changers initiative is discussed and focus is drawn to one of its programmes titled; escapED, for developing non-digital GBL approaches within the context of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics combined with Arts (STEAM) education. EscapED, aids the design and creation of educational Escape Rooms and Interactive Gaming Experiences for staff and students in further/higher education settings. The authors present the escapED theoretical framework as a tool to aid future design and development of on-site interactive experiences, in order to provide engaging alternatives for learning and soft skills development amongst higher education staff and students. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","","Education; Students; Digital platforms; Game-based Learning; Interactive gaming; Potential benefits; Science , Technology , Engineering and Mathematics; Soft-skills development; State-of-the-art technology; Theoretical framework; Engineering education","","","","","","","Arnab S., Clarke S., Towards a trans-disciplinary methodology for a game-based intervention development process, Br.

Several successful studies using game-based learning are reported in the literature. However, there appears to be a research gap on systematically evaluating accelerated learning in game environments. The main research question we address in this paper is how can we evaluate accelerated learning in game-based learning environments? The main contribution of this paper will be a framework for evaluating accelerated learning in games (ALF). We will illustrate the use of this framework by describing studies conducted in the Norwegian industrial project ALTT (Accelerate Learning Through Technology), aimed at capacity building in the aluminium industry, where we have co-designed a game for accelerating learning about the electrolysis process for extracting aluminium and heat balance in the aluminium production cells. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Accelerated learning; Cognitive skills; Game-based learning; Workplace learning","Aluminum; Accelerated learning; Aluminium production; Cognitive skill; Electrolysis process; Game-based Learning; Industrial projects; Learning and cognitive; Workplace learning; Computer aided instruction","","","","","Norges Forskningsråd","The authors would like to thank the Norwegian Research Council and the project participants from Hydro, Attensi, Cybernetica and SINTEF.","Morgan J., Why the Millions We Spend on Employee Engagement Buy Us So Little, Harvard Business Review, (2017); de Freitas S., Oliver M., How can exploratory learning with games and simulations within the curriculum be most effectively evaluated?, Comput.

However their so-called 21st century skills such as communication, leadership, and overall teamplay become distinctive in nowadays jobs. Teaching these often tacit skills and attitudes requires an underpinned approach. In this paper we operationalise experiential learning, using a multiplayer game to create the necessary engagement. With this consequential workshop format we created a game-based workshop in which 120 aspiring professionals participated. The results of this exploratory experiment are promising. All participants left the workshop with a clear actionable view to improve team performance. The results of the personality test that is part of the workshop yield an unexpected result. A modified version of workshop may be implemented as a training recommendation instrument for forthcoming students. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","21st century skills; Agility; Experiential learning; MBTI; Methodology; Serious gaming","Personnel training; 21st century skills; Agility; Experiential learning; MBTI; Methodology; Serious gaming; Education","","","","","","","(2010); Brandt T.M., Edinger P., Transformational leadership in teams - the effects of a team leader’s sex and personality, Gend.

A way to facilitate such a reflection is by means of a so-called debriefing phase. However, a human facilitated debriefing is expensive, time consuming and not always possible. Therefore, an automatic self-debriefing facility for serious games would be desirable. However, a general approach for creating such an automatic self-debriefing system for serious games doesn’t exist. As a first step towards the development of such a framework, we targeted a specific type of serious games, i.e., games displaying realistic behavior and having multiple possible paths to a solution. In addition, we decided to start with the development of a debriefing system for a concrete case, a serious game about cyber bullying in social networks. In particular, in this paper, we focus on different visualizations that could be used for such an automatic debriefing. We combined a textual feedback with three different types of visualizations. A prototype was implemented and evaluated with the goal of comparing the three visualizations and gathering first feedback on the usability and effectiveness. The results indicate that the visualizations did help the participants in having a better understanding of the outcome of the game and that there was a clear preference for one of the three visualizations. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","","Visualization; Cyber bullying; Learning Transfer; Serious games; Computer games","","","","","","","Peters V.A.M., Vissers G.A.N., A simple classification model for debriefing simulation games.

This is particularly relevant in Serious Games, where the main goal could be educational, pedagogical, etc. Therefore, understanding the players’ emotions during the game fruition could provide a valid support to the developers and researchers in video games field in order to design a more effective product. The presented research is a starting point to propose a framework for the determination of the player emotions through physiological information. We acquire several signals: facial electromyography, electrocardiogram, galvanic skin response, and respiration rate. We then compare the data to an emotional player assessment, defined using a valence and an arousal vector, through the application of Machine Learning techniques. The obtained results seem to suggest that the proposed approach can represent a valid tool to analyze the players’ emotions. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Affective Computing; Emotion detection; Feature selection; Machine Learning; Physiological data; Serious game; Video game","Artificial intelligence; Computer games; Education; Electromyography; Electrophysiology; Feature extraction; Human computer interaction; Interactive computer graphics; Learning systems; Physiology; Product design; Affective Computing; Emotion detection; Facial electromyographies; Galvanic skin response; Machine learning techniques; Physiological data; Physiological informations; Video game; Serious games","","","","","","","Fullerton T., Game Design Workshop: A Playcentric Approach to Creating Innovative Games, (2014); Damasio A.R., Tranel D., Damasio H.C., Behavior: Theory and preliminary testing, Frontal Lobe Function and Dysfunction, (1991); Damasio A.R., Descartes’ Error: Emotion, Reason, and the Human Brain, (1994); Grodal T., Video games and the pleasures of control, Media Entertainment: The Psychology of Its Appeal, pp. 197-213, (2000); Granic I., Lobel A., Engels R.C.M.E., The benefits of playing video games, Am.

This initiated the emergence of serious games and gamification to exploit game elements and mechanics for increasing the motivation in non-game contexts. The research reported in this paper used psychological theories of Self-Determination Theory (SDT) and Self-Efficacy Theory (SET) to design three versions of a game. The first version was based on SDT, the second on SET and the third version was based on a combination of these two theories. The objective is to investigate the impact of each game design on the user motivation and performance. An experiment of playing the games designed with these features was conducted. Surprisingly, the results on the objective evaluation revealed that there is no significant difference among the groups in terms of engagement and performance. Furthermore, these findings were confirmed by the results on the subjective evaluation of player’s perceived motivation, which showed no significant difference between the three experimental conditions. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Engagement; Game design; Motivation; Self-determination; Self-efficacy","Human computer interaction; Motivation; Engagement; Experimental conditions; Game design; Self efficacy; Self-determination; Self-determination theories; Self-efficacy theories; Subjective evaluations; Serious games","","","","","Hands-Free Computing Ltd; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (687676); European Commission, EC; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología, CONACYT","Funding text 1: This research has been conducted with the financial support of the European Union through the Beaconing project (Horizon 2020-Grant Number 687676).

The project aimed at involving all the students regardless of their personal interest, as a standard school activity. The case study proved to be successful with respect to students’ interest and their ability to reach the main project’s objectives. Their skills increased along the project and students demonstrated to be on the right path to develop a complete and autonomous approach to Computational Thinking. Nevertheless, a longer time span would be needed to for students to master deeply the new concepts and tools. Sometimes abstraction can be difficult and concrete activities are needed to introduce new ideas. Furthermore, students showed little autonomy and a limited use of the social aspects of the chosen programming environment. Devoting a longer time to the learning path would help fostering these skills. Finally, a close integration of the learning path with the school curriculum is envisaged. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Coding; Computational thinking; Game making; Primary education","Curricula; Social aspects; Close integration; Coding; Computational thinkings; Concrete activities; Game making; Primary education; Primary schools; Programming environment; Students","","","","","","","Wing J.M., Computational thinking, Commun.

The results of a pilot study show that the use of TrueBiters resulted in an improvement of the learning outcome for logically-mathematically intelligent players. The results of a pilot study on game experience show differences for kinesthetically intelligent and logically-mathematically intelligent players with respect to certain game experience aspects.

Teachers can create teams and assign an avatar to students, as well as points and ‘powers’ as rewards for desired behavior. Classcraft aims to foster players’ social engagement. We conducted a preliminary study on classrooms from Switzerland. The objective aims to characterize the social component of players’ engagement. Our approach is based on the identification of engaged-behaviors. This work is grounded on the idea that players’ engagement encompasses four components (environmental, social, self-component and action). We developed a methodology based on playing analytics to monitor players’ behavior. The detection of socially engaged-behaviors is based on the collection and analysis of players’ digital interactions with kTBS4LA, a playing analytics tools. Different categories of players emerged in terms of social engagement. The data collected shows that social engagement varies across time, classroom or gender. This variation seems linked both to specific game features. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","","Education; Interactive computer graphics; Analytics tools; Classroom management; Digital interactions; High school; Role-playing game; Social components; Social engagement; Switzerland; Teaching","","","","","","","Sanchez E., Young S., Jouneau-Sion C., Classcraft: From gamification to ludicization of classroom management, Educ.

However, the number of mobile learning games actually used for outdoor education remains very low. The absence of dedicated applications allowing to build MLGs, without technical expertise, is certainly one of the most important factors. To overcome this limitation, we propose a design method for MLG authoring tools, based on reusable components. We describe in this paper the design and first results of Moggle-Designer, a full-web MLG authoring tool requiring no technical expertise. We detail how a model-based approach, combined with component-oriented programming, adequately allow the representation and manipulation of didactic expert knowledge. Finally, we present Moggle-Player, an application for running the designed MLGs on any mobile browser. Moggle-Designer was used to design several mobile games that have been tested during a pilot study in a botanical park. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Authoring tool; Mobile learning; Serious games; Situated learning","Computer software reusability; Design; E-learning; Serious games; Authoring tool; Component oriented programming; Cultural heritage Education; Mobile Learning; Model based approach; Reusable components; Situated learning; Technical expertise; Education","","","","","","","Lee H., Parsons D., Kwon G., Kim J., Petrova K., Jeong E., Ryu H., Cooperation begins: Encouraging critical thinking skills through cooperative reciprocity using a mobile learning game, Comput.

This paper reviews the design of games that aim to influence household energy consumption. The designs of ten games are analyzed. From this review, suggestions for the design of a new game have been identified, such as presence of a strong storyline, real live missions, customized game characters, monitoring the electricity meter, etc. Based on this comparative analysis, a new game focused on reducing energy consumption has been designed and its prototype is described and will be demonstrated at the conference. In the next stage of iterative design, end-users will be involved by means of focus groups. This considerate user-centered design process allows us to build a serious game that is effective in reducing household energy consumption. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","","Design; Energy utilization; Human computer interaction; Comparative analysis; Electricity meters; Household energy; Household energy consumption; Iterative design; Reducing energy consumption; Serious games; User-centered design process; User centered design","","","","","","","Adams E., Fundamentals of Game Design, (2014); Bang M., Torstensson C., Katzeff C., The PowerHouse: A persuasive computer game designed to raise awareness of domestic energy consumption, PERSUASIVE 2006.

Yet, despite their great potential for education, the use of MLGs by teachers, remains limited. This is partly due to the fact that MLGs are often designed to match a specific learning context, and thus cannot be reusable for other contexts. Therefore, researchers have recently designed various types of MLG authoring tools. However, these authoring tools are not always adapted to non-computer-scientists or non-game-designers. Hence, we propose in this paper to focus on five existing MLG authoring tools, in order to assess their features and usability with the help of five teachers, who are used to organizing educational field trips. In the second part of this paper, we present an approach for designing a MLG authoring tool, based on the lacks identified through the analysis, and tailored to the teachers’ different profiles and needs. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","Assessment; Authoring tool; Mobile learning game; Usability","E-learning; Education; Teaching; Assessment; Authentic learning; Authoring tool; Computer scientists; Game designers; Mobile Learning; Specific learning; Usability; Computer games","","","","","","","Admiraal W., Huizenga J., Akkerman S., Ten Dam G., The concept of flow in collaborative game-based learning, Comput.

In this game, players were exposed to surprising situations that challenged their level of performance which eventually should help them to acquire crucial mental readiness when real crisis situations emerge. During exposure to surprises, measurements were taken online from players’ left prefrontal cortex, using an electroencephalogram (EEG) device. Two groups of participants were compared at three common surprising events (SEs) during the game, with only one group being exposed to seven preceding SEs. First, mean amplitude power (MAP) values in Delta band were indeed significantly lower during exposure to SEs compared to their baseline pre-game status which points to a more wakeful state. Secondly, comparing MAP values in the Alpha band showed a significant difference as was expected, with the group with preceding surprises having higher MAPs, indicating less cortical activation which is interpreted as being more relaxed and conscious. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","","Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Cortical activation; Crisis situations; Electro-encephalogram (EEG); Exposed to; Innovative approaches; Prefrontal cortex; Serious games; Electroencephalography","","","","","Royal Netherlands Air Force, (080.14.3903.10)","This study is part of the Serious Gaming project supported by the Royal Netherlands Air Force under contract 080.14.3903.10.","Murugappan M., Ramachandran N., Sazali Y., Classification of human emotion from EEG using discrete wavelet transform, J.

We developed a game for learning math with its core element based on the number line estimation task. In this task, participants have to indicate the position of a target number on a number-line, which is thought to train basic numerical skills. Participants completed both the game on a mobile device and a conventional paper-pencil version of the task. They indicated to have significantly more fun using the game-based environment. However, they also made considerably higher estimation errors in the game compared to the paper-pencil version. In this case, more fun in a math-learning task was ultimately bought at the expense of lower reliability, namely lowered accuracy of estimations in the learning game. This fun-accuracy trade-off between adding elements for enjoyment and clarity of content is discussed together with the consequences for game-design. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Enjoyment; Game-based learning; Mathematics; Number-line estimation; Reliability; User-experience","Economic and social effects; Mathematical techniques; Reliability; Core elements; Enjoyment; Estimation errors; Game-based Learning; Learning game; Learning tasks; Line estimation; User experience; Estimation","","","","","","","Plass J.L., Kaplan U., Emotional design in digital media for learning, Emotions, Technology, Design, and Learning, pp. 131-161, (2016); Boyle E.A., Et al., An update to the systematic literature review of empirical evidence of the impacts and outcomes of computer games and serious games, Comput.

The goal is to motivate people and to increase engagement for tasks. However, the empirical research remains limited, due to the unclear definition of the term gamification and an underdeveloped theory. The research at hand tries to narrow this gap by conducting a laboratory experiment to test the effects of gamification on the performance of subjects in a rather boring task. Beyond this, we tried to capture the motivation of the subjects during and after the experiment using different questionnaires. This was done to provide deeper insights into the interim step between gamification and performance. We could identify some significant motivational effects, though the performance was not increased. The results indicate that different gamification elements do not cumulate their influence. Experiments and the measurement of motivational effects of gamification elements provide an interesting research opportunity for future research. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Experiment; Flow; Gamification; Motivation","Experiments; Surveys; Empirical research; Flow; Gamification; Laboratory experiments; Pilot studies; Research opportunities; Motivation","","","","","","","Darejeh A., Salim S., Gamification solution to enhance software user engagement - a systematic review, Int.

The aim of this study was to investigate design principles for working memory training games. A game called Brain Farmer was designed and developed as part of this study. Brain Farmer is a working memory game based on n-back working memory training protocol and it is targeted especially for older adults. Users’ playing experiences were studied and design principles were identified based on observations, user feedback, and interviews. The most important design principles were found to be the simple and easily understandable game play, adaptation of challenge level as well as clear multisensory instructions and feedback. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","","Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Challenge levels; Complex cognitive tasks; Design Principles; Game-Based; Multisensory; nocv1; Older adults; User feedback; Working memory; Agriculture","","","","","","","Khoo E.T., Cheok A.D., Age invaders: Inter-generational mixed reality family game, Int.

Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are one of the most important innovations in the learning field. Still, it is a challenge to motivate learners and to keep them motivated in such huge learning environments. To address this challenge, we redesigned a board game targeting at an integrated view on disruption and communication management in an intermodal transportation situation. From the redesign, we have learned that an online game works better with fewer roles, requires immediate feedback, and an engaging way of challenge to keep players motivated. Our findings can inform the design of games for large groups of players in an online environment. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","","E-learning; Intermodal transportation; Communication management; Design considerations; Immediate feedbacks; Large-scale learning; Learning environments; Logistics and transportations; Massive open online course; Online environments; Computer aided instruction","","","","","DINALOG-TKI; TKI DINALOG","The Dutch Institute for Advanced Logistics (DINALOG-TKI) funded this research initiative.","Kafai Y.B., Peppler K.A., Beyond small groups: New opportunities for research in computer-supported collective learning, Connecting Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning to Policy and Practices: CSCL11 Community Events Proceedings, 2, pp. 910-911, (2011); Bakki A., Oubahssi L., Cherkaoui C., George S., Motivation and Engagement in Moocs: How to Increase Learning Motivation by Adapting Pedagogical Scenarios?, 9307, pp. 556-559, (2015); Romero M., Usart M., Serious Games Integration in an Entrepreneurship Massive Online Open Course (MOOC), 8101, pp. 212-225, (2013); Voulgari I., Sampson G.D., Massive open online courses (MOOCs) and massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs): Synergies and lessons to be learned, Digital Systems for Open Access to Formal and Informal Learning, pp. 41-56, (2014); Endsley M.R., Toward a theory of situation awareness in dynamic systems, Hum.

Ninety-eight students from a local primary school have played with three different versions of a game: immersive using a Head Mounted Display, semi immersive played on a computer screen and non-immersive in which no movement was possible for the player. Results do not support the initial hypothesis: no significant impact from the immersion level has been found on performance. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","","Helmet mounted displays; Computer screens; Head mounted displays; Immersive; Initial hypothesis; Perspective taking; Primary schools; Spatial reasoning; Computer games","","","","","","","OECD: Evolution of Student Interest in Science and Technology Studies – Policy Report, (2006); Rocard M., Csermely P., Jorde D., Lenzen D., Walwerg-Heriksson H., Hemmo V., Science Education NOW: A Renewed Pedagogy for the Future of Europe, (2007); Sinclair N., Bruce C.D., New opportunities in geometry education at the primary school, ZDM, 47, 3, pp. 319-329, (2015); Newcombe N.S., Picture this: Increasing math and science learning by improving spatial thinking, Am.

Typically, these games target communication skills, social interaction and speech. There are, however, few SGs for autistic children which have the aim of helping to moderate sensory hypersensitivity. This paper presents an SG which aims to target this area. A set of critical sounds was heuristically determined, and implemented in an interactive SG for reducing auditory hypersensitivity (i.e. over-sensitivity to environmental sounds) in children with ASD. The game, Sinbad and the Magic Cure, is designed for Android devices, and is intended for children aged 8–11. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Auditory hypersensitivity; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Game-based therapy; Hyperacusis; Moderating sensory hypersensitivity; Serious games","Curing; Diseases; Speech communication; Auditory hypersensitivity; Autism spectrum disorders; Game-Based; Hyperacusis; Moderating sensory hypersensitivity; Serious games","","","","","King Abdullah Scholarship Program","Acknowledgments.

We exploited the pervasiveness of smartphone and serious games concept to develop a gamified environment for the road users. Our approach comprises two games that would gamify the driver performance based on the driver performance assessment results. The driver performance will be evaluated using a smartphone-based evaluator and the assessment results will be transmitted through a Bluetooth module to the gamified environment (this happens on real-time basis).

To improve their outcomes and increase their adoption in this domain, we propose new ways in which serious games can leverage the information extracted from player interactions, beyond the usual post-activity analysis. We focus on the use of: (1) open data which can be shared for research purposes, (2) real-time feedback for teachers that apply games in schools, to maintain awareness and control of their classroom, and (3) once enough data is gathered, data mining to improve game design, evaluation and deployment; and allow teachers and students to benefit from enhanced feedback or stealth assessment. Having developed and tested a game learning analytics platform throughout multiple experiments, we describe the lessons that we have learnt when analyzing learning analytics data in the previous contexts to improve serious games. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Dashboards; Game-based learning; Learning analytics; Serious games; Stealth assessment","Data mining; Feedback; Open Data; Students; Activity analysis; Dashboards; Formal education; Game-based Learning; Learning analytics; Real-time feedback; Research purpose; Stealth assessment; Serious games","","","","","Regional Government of Madrid, (S2013/ICE-2715); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (687676); European Commission, EC, (BEACONING H2020-ICT-2015-687676, IMPRESS 2017-1-NL01-KA203-035259, RAGE H2020-ICT-2014-1-644187); Ministry of Education, MOE, (TIN2017-89238-R)","Acknowledgments.

In our research project SPIRIT, we develop a mobile location-based serious game, which enhances museum communications in an entertaining way. By integrating elements of interactive digital storytelling through augmented reality, e.g. interactions with virtual characters, the app converts history lessons into vibrant adventures. By using the app, mobile devices are transformed into “magical equipment”, which leads users to the spirit of the past in certain places on site. This paper examines selected economic issues of museum apps, focusing on the potential interest in and willingness to pay for these apps.

The paper proposes and develops a design tool called DEMO (DEsign for MOtivation) that aims to address motivation in innovation communities. The DEMO tool is theoretically grounded in motivation theories and based on existing game-like approaches for the development of motivational concepts. The tool incorporates gamification elements, design elements and targets to support multidisciplinary teams in designing for motivation. One application area of the tool is in innovation communities where the design to support user participation and contribution is a complex task, while there is limited understanding how to practically apply motivation. An expert usability evaluation reflected a positive overall experience with the tool. The contribution of this paper lies in its description of the tool and its report on the usability evaluation. Future research in the field should focus on the application of the design tool with various methods in diverse cases. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","DEMO; Design tool; Innovation community; Motivation; Usability study","Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; DEMO; Design tool; Innovation communities; Motivation theories; Multi-disciplinary teams; nocv1; Usability evaluation; Usability studies; User participation; Motivation","","","","","Center for Service Innovation; Norges Forskningsråd","This research is funded by the Norwegian Research Council through the Center for Service Innovation (csi.nhh.no).

Fogg’s conceptual framework on the role computer technology plays for users, in this paper it will be argued that persuasion through digital games can be approached from three different perspectives: digital games can be used as media for persuasion, digital games can be used as tools for persuasion and digital games can be used as social actors for persuasion. In this paper, I use four cancer gaming cases to illustrate how these three different persuasive roles can be used to accomplish different persuasive goals. The categorization proposed in this paper can serve to clarify what we mean when we refer to persuasion in relation to digital games and can be used as analytical approach for the study of persuasive gaming strategies. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","","Behavioral research; Diseases; Analytical approach; Cancer patients; Computer technology; Conceptual frameworks; Digital games; Persuasive gaming; Social actors; Computer games","","","","","Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO, (314-99-106)","This work is part of the research programme “Persuasive Gaming in Context: From theory-based design to validation and back” with project number 314-99-106 which is financed by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO).","Deal D., The ability of branded online games to build brand equity: An exploratory study, Digra 2005 Conference: Changing Views-Worlds in Play, (2005); Wise K., Bolls P.D., Kim H., Venkataram A., Meyer R., Enjoyment of advergames and brand attitudes: The impact of thematic relevance, J.

Users search for means of entertainment during their workout. Motivation is an essential factor that inspires a person to maintain physical activity levels. A number of exercise bicycle manufacturers have enabled their equipment to port data signals to computers for the purpose of training logs. However, they all lack the motivational and the fun factors in their system. Many people face obstacles to improve their physical activity due to lack of accessibility to physical activity facilities and physical trainers. Technology can provide immediate personal assistance anywhere and anytime. In this paper, we present a persuasive game environment integrated to cycle training. The system measures the performance of a rider and visualizes a scenario through which the virtual bike trip leads. The players maintain their excitement while riding the bicycle to improve their performance on how to enhance cycling skills. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","Android; Exergaming; Persuasive technology; Test environment","Bicycles; Android; Exergaming; Game environment; Human Machine Interface; Persuasive technology; Physical activity; Physical activity levels; Test Environment; Personnel training","","","","","","","Bolton J., Lambert M., Lirette D., Unsworth B., PaperDude,: A virtual reality cycling exergame, CHI 2014 Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 475-478, (2014); Hirose S., Kitamura Y., Preliminary Evaluation of Virtual Cycling System Using Google Street View, 9072, pp. 65-70, (2015); Kurniawan S., Walker M., Arteaga S.M., Motivating Teenagers Physical Activity through Mobile Games, (2010); Consolvo S., Klasnja P., McDonald D.W., Landay J.A., Goal-Setting Considerations for Persuasive Technologies that Encourage Physical Activity, (2009); Gardiner M.A.M., Physically healthy game interfaces, The University of Auckland, Viewed, (2012); Chittaro L., Sioni R., Turning the Classic Snake Mobile Game into a location– Based Exergame that Encourages Walking, 7284, pp. 43-54, (2012); Lin J.J., Mamykina L., Lindtner S., Delajoux G., Strub H.B., Fish‘n’Steps: Encouraging Physical Activity with an Interactive Computer Game, 4206, pp. 261-278, (2006); Fogg B.J., Persuasive technology: Using computers to change what we think and do, Ubiquity, 2002, (2002); Mok E., Wong K.-Y., Effects of music on patient anxiety, AORN J, 77, 2, pp. 396-410, (2003); Tanaka H., Monahan K.D., Seals D.R., Age-predicted maximal heart rate revisited, J.

To this end, serious games offer remarkable possibilities to foster learning in this area. However, evidences suggest that these potentialities have not been fully leveraged yet. In particular, it is challenging to design games representing the different domains (ecology, economics, politics, and culture) and social structures (individuals, families and communities) involved by sustainability issues. This work explores the mix of augmented reality, collaborative gaming and theoretical guidelines in the design of Sustain, an educational game focused on raising awareness on sustainability topics. The paper details Sustain design decisions, highlighting their relation with the chosen methodology. Our aims are: (i) to exemplify the use of a not yet adopted theoretical background, and (ii) to present reflections concerning its use. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","Augmented reality; Collaborative games; Educational games; Sustainability","Augmented reality; Collaborative games; Collaborative gaming; Design decisions; Different domains; Educational game; Foster learning; Social structure; Sustainability issues; Sustainable development","","","","","","","Antle A.N., Tanenbaum J., Bevans A., Seaborn K., Wang S., Balancing Act: Enabling Public Engagement with Sustainability Issues through a Multi-Touch Tabletop Collaborative Game, 6947, pp. 194-211, (2011); Burton I., Report on reports: Our common future: The world commission on environment and development, Environ.

This paper synthetizes the results of a recent statistical analysis of auditory attention of non-native learners and proposes indications for serious game design. We propose a 3-dimensional difficulty level model that can be applied both for designing game levels and adaptivity to keep a player in the flow. The model suggests using background noise level as a prime factor to increase the difficulty of the game, followed by the length of the stimulus and the semantic complexity of the message. We also propose the concept of a mini-game format specifically aimed at training auditory attention and performance. As a format, it could be easily customized in different context domains and implemented as a service or a game engine plug-in. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Adaptivity; Attention score; Auditory attention; Language skill; Learning environment; Non-native learners; Serious game","Computer aided instruction; Semantics; Adaptivity; Attention score; Auditory attention; Language skill; Learning environments; Non-native; Serious games","","","","","","","Kail R., Speed of information processing: Developmental change and links to intelligence, J.

The design process focused on three key aspects of serious games derived from the Input-Process-Outcome model of learning with games by Garris and Driskell. In order to introduce knowledge, skills and attitudes with regard to safety and health at the workplace we systematically developed (a) the instructional content, (b) the game characteristics and (c) the context of use, which defines how the game is used and how the debriefing can be realized. As a result, “simkult” is a multi-player simulation game for five to 20 persons which addresses work teams in small and middle sized companies. By putting each player in the position of a restaurant manager the complex interplay of important areas towards safety and health at work (e.g. work climate, leadership) are displayed. Two core aspects within the game are the non-player characters and critical incidents which represent quests for the players in the simulation. These were developed with regard to the target group’s needs in order to create an engaging and effective serious game. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Health prevention; Learning; Serious game","Design; Education computing; Health; Critical incidents; Design process; Game for healths; Learning; Non-player character; Safety and health at work; Safety and healths; Simulation games; Serious games","","","","","Deutsche Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung, DGUV","Acknowledgements.

In light of this transition, we discuss initial results towards the development of a serious gaming environment where river and floodplain management actors can collaboratively explore intervention and maintenance strategies. We introduce the design approach of a serious gaming environment based on qualitative interviews with river and floodplain maintenance actors. Based on these interviews, we identified two key variables to explore strategies for river and floodplain maintenance: maintenance intervals and floodplain scaling. We proceed with presenting the Virtual River; a concept for a serious gaming environment. In this environment, actors can play out intervention and maintenance scenarios around these two key variables over time using simplified hydrological, morphodynamic and vegetation models. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","","Banks (bodies of water); Environmental management; Flood control; Floods; Maintenance; Rivers; Design approaches; Floodplain management; Maintenance intervals; Maintenance scenario; Maintenance strategies; Management strategies; Qualitative interviews; Vegetation model; Serious games","","","","","Stichting voor de Technische Wetenschappen, STW, (P12-P14)","Research for this paper was conducted as part of the program RiverCare: towards self-sustaining multifunctional rivers, funded by the Technology Foundation STW (Grant Number P12-P14).

Heavy alcohol use at this young age can lead to health and school-related problems and is a severe societal problem. Strengthening of cognitive control mechanisms through computerized training has been shown to have positive effects on behavior, but is often perceived as a tedious exercise. Applying novel serious gaming techniques to evidence-based training paradigms may offer a solution to this motivational problem. This paper describes the design and analysis plan that will be used to evaluate an innovative Serious Game called The Fling, aimed specifically at increasing cognitive control over impulses in adolescents. The game will be evaluated in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) among adolescents between 15–18 years in mainstream and special education. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","Adolescents; Cognitive training; Inhibition; Motivation; Serious games","Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Enzyme inhibition; Motivation; Adolescents; Behavioral control; Cognitive control; Cognitive training; Design and analysis; Randomized controlled trial; Societal problems; Special education; Serious games","","","","","Universiteit Utrecht, UU","The authors wish to thank our collaborators at Shosho Amsterdam, Harold de Groot and Frank van Vugt in particular, for their invaluable contributions to the game’s design and development.

Data is usually collected from online activities such as forums or virtualized courses hosted on Learning Management Systems (e.g. Moodle). Educational games are emerging as a popular type of e-learning content and their high interactivity makes them potential sources for relevant educational user data. However, it is still uncertain how to deploy and combine these two incipient technologies, as multiple challenges remain unresolved. This paper reports on our practical experience using LA to improve assessment of experimental research on educational game-based instruction. In the last year, we conducted four experiments evaluating game-based instruction under different conditions (using three adventure games and a puzzle game respectively) in 13 educational institutions including schools, universities and vocational training organizations. A LA system was used to track interaction around six hundred students. In these experiences, we encountered several problems in each of the steps of the process, from issues related to the design of the experiment and the game to different technical and practical problems, derived from the very diverse conditions of the facilities and policies of each institution (computer laboratories, computers hardware, software installed, irregular Internet access), which hinders the data collecting process (e.g. the system had to deal with high latency Internet connections and backup plans had to be devised for collecting data when no Internet access was available). We present the lessons learned and propose guidelines from a technical and practical perspective for the design of experimental research using both LA systems and educational games. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.","","Educational game; Practical experience","","","","","","","Johnson L., Adams S., Cummins M., The New Media Consortium, (2012); Hays R.T., The effectiveness of instructional games: A literature review and discussion, (2005); Johnson L., Adams Becker S., Cummins M., Estrada V., Freeman A., Ludgate H., (2013); Pivec P., Game-based Learning or Game-based Teaching?

The SG Studies Database is an instrument devised to allow sharing structured information about SGs. This information can be used by scholars and practitioners also to perform comparative analysis and identify components and modules that could be used in different games. The SG Studies database, which is freely available online on the site of the Serious Games Society, relies on a SG description model, that has been defined in order to allow a structured description of SGs, considering the perspectives of different stakeholders and contexts of use, and spurring the identification of SG components and their relationship with pedagogical theories and expected outcomes. The SG Studies database has already been used as a tool to support identification of reusable patterns and components in SGs, in order to identify best practices and favor module re-use. Other meta studies are possible in the future on the database by any parties. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","","Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Best practices; Comparative analysis; Description model; Educational potential; Efficient designs; Meta-study; Serious games; Structured information; Database systems","","","","","","","Sawyer B., Smith P., Serious Game Taxonomy, (2008); Zyda M., From visual simulation to virtual reality to games, Computer, 38, 9, pp. 25-32, (2005); Michael D., Chen S., Serious Games: Games that Educate, Train, and Inform, (2006); Egenfeldt-Nielsen S., Overview of research on the educational use of videogames, Digital Kompetanse, 3, 1, pp. 184-213, (2006); Kickmeier-Rust M.D., Talking digital educational games, Proceedings of the 1St International Open Workshop on Intelligent Personalization and Adaptation in Digital Educational Games, pp. 55-66, (2009); Djaouti D., Alvarez J., Jessel J.P., Methel G., Molinier P., A gameplay definition through videogame classification, Int.

This framework enables multimodal emotion recognition of learners during game-based learning. The main goal of this study is to validate the use of microphone data for a real-time and adequate interpretation of vocal expressions into emotional states were the software is calibrated with end users. FILTWAM already incorporates a valid face emotion recognition module and is extended with a voice emotion recognition module. This extension aims to provide relevant and timely feedback based upon learner’s vocal intonations. The feedback is expected to enhance learner’s awareness of his or her own behavior. Six test persons received the same computer-based tasks in which they were requested to mimic specific vocal expressions. Each test person mimicked 82 emotions, which led to a dataset of 492 emotions. All sessions were recorded on video. An overall accuracy of our software based on the requested emotions and the recognized emotions is a pretty good 74.6% for the emotions happy and neutral emotions; but will be improved for the lower values of an extended set of emotions. In contrast with existing software our solution allows to continuously and unobtrusively monitor learners’ intonations and convert these intonations into emotional states. This paves the way for enhancing the quality and efficacy of game-based learning by including the learner’s emotional states, and links these to pedagogical scaffolding. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.","Game-based learning; Human-computer interaction; Microphone; Multimodal emotion recognition; Real-time voice emotion recognition","Microphones; Emotion recognition; Game-based Learning; Multimodal emotion recognition; Human computer interaction","","","","","Netherlands Laboratory for Lifelong Learning; Open University, OU","We thank our colleagues who participated in the voice emotion recognition proof of concept study.

The current work deals with the design and development of serious games based on an instructional approach to train transferable skills in public administration settings. This approach can be a valuable way of supporting instructors when they are designing games for public employees in lifelong learning processes by means of metaphors or similar mechanisms close to their working experience. Such design process is also based on modeling mechanisms in order to formally represent the game components. The proposed approach is complemented with the use of a development tool to elaborate this type of game by mixing traditional design steps with an instructional strategy to provide structured learning bites in training settings. Several game prototypes have been developed to test this approach in the context of courses for public employees. The obtained outcomes reveal the wider possibilities of serious games as educational resources, as well as the use of game achievements to evaluate the acquisition of transferable skills. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","","Serious games","","","","","","","Kapp K.M., The gamification of learning and instruction: Game-based methods and strategies for training and education, Ed.

This is a shortcoming because of an increasing pervasiveness of serious games in organizational life, e.g. for operational training, management and leadership. Is it possible to establish marked relationships between psychometric constructs that measure ‘team composition and performance’ and ‘analytics’ that unobtrusively measure gameplay performance? If so, what are the implications for game-based team research and assessment? The authors conducted explorative, quasi-experimental (field) experiments with the multiplayer serious game TeamUp. One field experiment was conducted with 150 police officers as part of task-specific twoday team training. Research data were gathered through pre-game and postgame questionnaires on team constructs such as ‘psychological safety’ and ‘team cohesion’. A large quantity of in-game data was logged to construct indicators like ‘time needed to complete the task’, ‘speak time’ and ‘avoidable mistakes’ to measure team performance. The conclusion of the analysis is that ‘team cohesion’ and ‘psychological safety’ correlate moderately and significantly with in-game performance indicators. Teams with an unequal individual game performance speak the most, while teams with an equally low or equally high individual performance spend significantly less time speaking. The indicative findings support the need to further develop validated analytics and gamebased environments for team research and assessment. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.","","Digital games","","","","","","","Pearce C.L., Conger J.A., Shared Leadership: Reframing the Hows and Whys of Leadership, 57, 3, (2003); Gressick J., Derry S.J., Distributed leadership in online groups, Int.

Having the possibility to add to the traditional crisis management organization workforce also a higher number of citizens is thus very important. Despite of this, the general public seems to be ignorant of the possibility and consequences of a major flood. In this paper we present a game for promoting citizens’ preparedness to flooding situations, called Flooded. Flooded was designed using current flooding management elements, but having as main objective citizens’ sensitizations. Results of the evaluations show that the game was successful in promoting flood awareness, especially in terms of increasing the player’s knowledge of the local territory, but that a proper briefing and debriefing session is required to facilitate learning, retention and reflection. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.","","Location-based Games","","","","","","","Jonkman S.N., Global perspectives on loss of human life caused by floods.

However, the MOOC pedagogical model is almost exclusively a reproduction of the lectureoriented approach. We introduce a Game-Based Learning approach in a MOOC that aims to encourage entrepreneurship through the use of Serious Games (SG). In this study, we analyse the entrepreneurship skills developed in a Game-Based Learning MOOC (GBL MOOC) according to five assessed activities developed during the course: presentation and participation in a general debate; an entrepreneurial aptitude test; the Metavals SG; the Hot Shot Business SG; and a final questionnaire. The results of the final questionnaire show a good perception of the utility of the GBL MOOC for entrepreneurship studies, and an acceptable overall degree of satisfaction with the use of SGs during the MOOC. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.","","Competence assessments; Game-based Learning","","","","","Erasmus Project; GaLA; Network of Excellence Games and Learning Alliance; Seventh Framework Programme, FP7","This study has been developed in the context of the Network of Excellence Games and Learning Alliance (GaLA) and the Erasmus Project “Stimulating Entrepreneurship through Serious Games” (eSG) funded from the European Community’s Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013).","Mallon M.E., MOOCs, 9, 1, pp. 46-53, (2013); Cooper S., Sahami M., Reflections on Stanford’s MOOCs.

We have implemented a comparative analysis module to estimate the driver performance based on absolute and social comparisons. In this approach we simulated a road network of 40 vehicle users and analyzed the performance of the users by our interlinked system architecture dedicated for simulation, data sharing and representation of the entire information on Map-based user interface. Another key aspect that was performed in this approach was the usage of Map-Matching module to discard the inaccuracies in Geo-references while representing the coordinates on Google Maps.

One clear example is the increasing use of web-based digital games. However, the more interactive a piece of content is, the more difficult it is to make it universally accessible. Besides, users are increasingly demanding ubiquitous access to the content and applications they use (including games), resulting in a need for ensuring that Web content is also multiplatform. These trends are adding an extra technology challenge for ensuring content accessibility. In this paper we describe our technical approach to create an accessible multiplatform game engine for the new version of the eAdventure educational game authoring platform (eAdventure 2.0). This approach integrates accessibility as a core design principle instead of adding accessibility features a posteriori.

This framework enables real-time multimodal emotion recognition of learners during game-based learning for triggering feedback towards improved learning. The main goal of this study is to validate the integration of webcam and microphone data for a real-time and adequate interpretation of facial and vocal expressions into emotional states where the software modules are calibrated with end users. This integration aims to improve timely and relevant feedback, which is expected to increase learners’ awareness of their own behavior. Twelve test persons received the same computer-based tasks in which they were requested to mimic specific facial and vocal expressions. Each test person mimicked 80 emotions, which led to a dataset of 960 emotions. All sessions were recorded on video. An overall accuracy of Kappa value based on the requested emotions, expert opinions, and the recognized emotions is 0.61, of the face emotion recognition software is 0.76, and of the voice emotion recognition software is 0.58. A multimodal fusion between the software modules can increase the accuracy to 78 %. In contrast with existing software our software modules allow real-time, continuously and unobtrusively monitoring of learners’ face expressions and voice intonations and convert these into emotional states. This inclusion of learner’s emotional states paves the way for more effective, efficient and enjoyable game-based learning. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Affective computing; Game-based learning; Human-computer interaction; Microphone; Multimodal emotion recognition; Real-time emotion recognition; Webcam","Computer games; Computer software; Face recognition; Human computer interaction; Integration; Learning systems; Microphones; Statistical tests; Affective Computing; Game-based Learning; Multimodal emotion recognition; Real-time emotion recognition; Webcam; Speech recognition","","","","","","","Anaraki F., Developing an effective and efficient eLearning platform, Int.

Children with ADHD may show symptoms of time perception problems. Although ADHD is a clinical diagnosis with several approaches, no diagnostic tool has been designed to detect the symptoms of time perception problems in ADHD children. A computer game can be a powerful tool to be used as part of the psychological assessment and yield better accuracy in ADHD diagnosis.

The latter focuses on teaching children aged 7–10 the importance of understanding the benefits of cooperation as well as expressing trustworthiness. Gamification of Prosocial Theory has led to several game mechanics being redefined, in order to turn traditional games’ elements of competition into cooperation evaluation mechanisms. Using these mechanisms, children are called upon to adapt their gameplay behavior towards expressing prosociality and understanding each other’s needs. Our experiments solidify this concept, by showcasing promising indications on the game’s potential to help children understand when it is a good idea to adopt a prosocial behavior. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Game design; Multiplayer games; Prosocial behaviour; Serious games","Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Digital games; Entertainment industry; Game contents; Game design; Gamification; Multiplayer games; Prosocial behaviour; Serious games; Education","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (644204)","The research leading to this work has received funding from the EU Horizon 2020 Framework Programme under grant agreement no. 644204 (ProsocialLearn project).","Anderson C.A., Bushman B.J., Effects of violent video games on aggressive behavior, aggressive cognition, aggressive affect, physiological arousal, and prosocial behavior: A meta-analytic review of the scientific literature, Psychol.

In this paper, we present a learning system based on the simple card game High or Low that helps to teach fundamental principles of statistics and risk management. In addition, we provide a computer prognosis to the players. Results show that if students are forced to calculate the likelihood and make the decision which option to choose on their own, the outcome is acceptable. But if a computer generated prognosis is given, a high percentage of students rely on the prognosis even if it is obviously not correct. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Card games; Game based learning; Risk management; Statistics","Risk assessment; Statistics; Students; Card games; Computer generated; Formal concepts; Fundamental principles; Game-based Learning; Teaching statistics; Risk management","","","","","","","Asan A., School experience course with multimedia in teacher education, J.

Adaptive Games strive to keep the challenges presented by the game balanced with the player’s abilities, as to keep the player in the “flow” state. We have used a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) approach to develop a simple adaptive SG for teaching basic elements of probability to high school and entry-level university students, called The Journey. The game performs continuously the updating of a user model with the competences of the student and presents the new challenges according to the student’s current level. This paper presents details of the educational aspects of the game, as well as of its implementation. It also presents a preliminary validation study and discusses future work. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","","Education computing; Information services; Students; Adaptive games; Adaptive serious games; Basic elements; Current levels; Educational aspects; Simple adaptive; University students; Validation study; Service oriented architecture (SOA)","","","","","European Commission, EC; 7th Framework Programme for Research and Development, (258114 NEXT-TELL); EACEA Agency of the European Commission, (EMJD ICE FPA n 2010-0012)","This work has been partially funded by the EC, through the GALA EU Network of Excellence in Serious Games (FP7-ICT-2009-5-258169).

Mobile devices enable individuals to learn anywhere and anytime, even if only little time is available. Usually, m-learning is often seen as e-learning on mobile devices. This disregards the real potential of m-learning. Instead, the characteristics of mobility should be taken into account when designing m-learning, namely different places of learning and the process of location change. In this paper, we therefore introduce the concept of location-sequence-based learning (LSBL) that explicitly considers these characteristics. Then, we combine LSBL with the concept of game based learning (GBL) in order to even enhance the motivational aspect of both concepts. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Education; Location-based learning; M-Learning; Sequence-based learning","Curricula; Education; Location; Mobile devices; Class rooms; Game-based Learning; Learning process; Location-based learning; M-Learning; Mobile games; Mobile Technology; Sequence-based learning; E-learning","","","","","","","Baker A., Navarro E.O., Van Der Hoek A., An experimental card game for teaching software engineering processes, J.

Communication and cooperation are basic skills needed for a well functioning team, especially in safety-critical domains like security. In this domain, the ability of a team to cooperate sometimes even decides about life and death. The development of situational awareness and understanding is seen as a prerequisite for effective teamwork. Traditional methods of enhancing teamwork related skills are limited due to their lack of flexibility and their distance to real world challenges. The study aims at exploring whether and how a simulation game should be designed in terms of fidelity to support situational awareness training. Results from usability tests show that realistic virtual environments imply the ability to foster teamwork related skills like situational awareness and communication. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.","","Simulation games; Situational awareness","","","","","","","Kriz W., Creating effective learning environments and learning organizations through gaming simulation design, Simul.

To avoid these costs, researchers are now trying to collect information through online multiplayer games with the underlying purpose of collecting scientific data. In this paper we present two case studies of such games created for data collection in music information retrieval (MIR): Emotify, for emotional annotation of music, and Hooked, for studying musical catchiness. In addition to the basic requirement of scientific validity, both applications address essential development and design issues, for example, acquiring licensed music or employing popular social frameworks. As such, we hope that they may serve as blueprints for the development of future serious games, not only for music but also for other humanistic domains.

Human dynamics are a significant driver of the overall effectiveness of these processes, yet the characterization of both the intraand inter-individual performance contribution is limited by sparse, qualitative, and often subjective observations. Recent advances in quantitative human-machine instrumentation have made possible greater objective study of users interacting with data; however, performance metrics leveraging these measurements are often narrow and ad hoc. When assessing the analytical and decision-making performance of teams, it is critical to know the information that members have observed, synthesized, and acted upon, and ad hoc approaches can be insufficient. In this paper we present a novel assessment framework based on the principles of Shannon information theory. We detail how this framework can holistically characterize decision information flows and describe its application to assess teams’ abilities to effectively discover data during serious games. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","","Information theory; Complex sociotechnical systems; Decision making process; Individual performance; Information-theoretic approach; Military environment; Multi-level decisions; Overall effectiveness; Shannon information theory; Decision making","","","","","Air Force, (FA8721-05-C-0002); Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering","This work was sponsored by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering under Air Force Contract FA8721-05-C-0002.

Over recent decades, Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL) has evolved into solutions that allow a higher learner engagement in authentic active-based learning activities. In this context, the educational digital games, also known as Serious Games (SG), allow learning English as a Second Language (ESL) in a playful and engaging environment. In this study, we develop a literature review on the current uses of SG in the context of CALL, in general, and ESL, specifically, in order to create a taxonomy of pedagogical uses of SG for ESL. The taxonomy could be of utility for teachers aiming to integrate SG in their ESL courses. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","","Computational linguistics; Computer aided instruction; Education; Linguistics; Taxonomies; Teaching; Computer assisted language learning; Digital games; Learning Activity; Learning English; Literature reviews; Pedagogical use; Second language; Serious games; E-learning","","","","","","","Escudeiro P., De Carvalho C.V., Game-based language learning, Int.

The present study tested a German serious game designed to teach fundamentals of civic engagement with a class of elementary school children (N = 26, mean age 10 years) from a socially disadvantaged urban population. Findings suggest that the young players liked the new mode of learning, but effects of playing on domain knowledge were not observed. We discuss the results with regard to the preconditions that serious games have to meet just as conventional instruction techniques when players/learners are facing specific challenges such as social disadvantages. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","","Education; Civic engagement; Domain knowledge; Elementary schools; Mean ages; Serious games; Social disadvantages; Urban population; Education computing","","","","","","","Gee J.P., What Video Games have to Teach Us about Learning and Literacy, (2003); Wouters P., Van Nimwegen C., Van Oostendorp H., Van Der Spek E.D., A meta-analysis of the cognitive and motivational effects of serious games, J.

In turn, serious games are increasingly recognized for their potential to improve education, but a typical requirement from instructors is to gain insight into how the students are playing. When we bring games into the rapidly growing online learning communities, the challenges multiply and hinder the potential effectiveness of serious games. There is a need to deliver a comprehensive, flexible and intelligent learning framework that facilitates better understanding of learners’ knowledge, effective assessment of their progress and continuous evaluation and optimization of the environments in which they learn. This paper aims to explore the potential in the use of games and learning analytics towards scaffolding and supporting teaching and learning experience. The conceptual model discussed aims to highlight key considerations that may advance the current state of learning analytics, adaptive learning and serious games, by leveraging serious games as an ideal medium for gathering data and performing adaptations. This opportunity has the potential to affect the design and deployment of education and training in the future. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","","Education computing; Scaffolds; Social networking (online); Teaching; Adaptive learning; Conceptual model; Education and training; Intelligent learning; Learning experiences; Online learning community; Personalized learning; Teaching and learning; E-learning","","","","","Seventh Framework Programme, FP7; European Commission, EC","This work has been co-funded by the EU under the FP7, in the Games and Learning Alliance (GALA) Network of Excellence, Grant Agreement nr. 258169, and the SCAFFOLD consortium.","ET; Silva E., Measuring skills for 21st-century learning, Phi Delta Kappan, 90, 9, pp. 630-634, (2009); Ananiadou K., Claro M., 21St Century Skills and Competencies for New Millennium Learners in OECD Countries, (2009); Salpeter J., 21St Century Skills: Will Our Students Be Prepared?, (2008); Dede C., Comparing Frameworks for 21St Century Skills, (2009); Developing Key Competencies at School in Europe: Challenges and Opportunities for Policy, (2012); Wood D., Brunet J., Ross G., The role of tutoring in problem solving, J.

As such it is still fragmented and needs to achieve critical mass to compete globally. Nevertheless its growth potential is widely recognized. To become competitive the relevant applied gaming communities and SMEs require support by fostering the generation of innovation potential. The European project Realizing an Applied Gaming Ecosystem (RAGE) is aiming at supporting this challenge. RAGE will help by making available an interoperable set of advanced technology assets, tuned to applied gaming, as well as proven practices of using asset-based applied games in various real-world contexts, and finally a centralized access to a wide range of applied gaming software modules, services and related document, media, and educational resources within an online community portal called the RAGE Ecosystem. It is based on an integrational, user-centered approach of Knowledge Management and Innovation Processes in the shape of a service-based implementation. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","","Ecology; Ecosystems; Electronic document exchange; Interoperability; Advanced technology; Educational resource; European project; Growth potential; Innovation potential; Innovation process; On-line communities; User-centered approach; Knowledge management","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (644187)","This publication has been produced in the context of the RAGE project.

In addition there has been speculation that digital games can support higher level thinking. In this paper we propose that viewing these gains from the perspective of executive functions can help to provide a more coherent approach to understanding the cognitive benefits of playing games. Executive functions refer to a range of higher level cognitive processes that regulate, control and manage other cognitive processes. Three models are considered: Baddeley’s model of working memory [1], and two models of executive functions, that of Anderson [2], and that of Diamond [3]. The implications for serious games research and games design and for future research are considered. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014","","Executive function; Learning outcome","","","","","Games and Learning Alliance; Network of Excellence for Serious Games; Seventh Framework Programme, FP7, (258169, FP7/2007 2013)","This work was partially supported by the Games and Learning Alliance (GaLA) - Network of Excellence for Serious Games via a grant to the second author under the European Community Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007 2013), Grant Agreement no. 258169.","Baddeley A.D., Working memory: Multiple models, multiple mechanisms, Science of Memory: Concepts, pp. 151-153, (2007); Anderson P.J., Assessment and development of executive function (EF) during childhood, Child Neuropsychol, 8, (2002); Diamond A., Executive functions, Annu.

But often there is too much relevant information a driver has to take into account and evaluate. A useful support can be provided by technology that can observe the driver’s situation, analyze it, and offer individualized information and services to the driver. Moreover, by means of gamification mechanisms drivers can receive valuable feedback and motivation to improve their behavior. This paper presents such a situation-aware gamification approach in logistics, which has been elaborated in the LogiAssist project and enhanced in the TEGA game. A first user study indicated the general usefulness of this approach and revealed also several shortcomings.

Among several important open issues, a critical question regards what features of video games may be more suitable to address social skills promotion and morality education, for example single and multiplayer gaming. Since the research states that individual characteristics may drive media preferences/acceptance, here we analyzed individual differences (personality traits and social tendencies) among players who prefer single/multiplayer gaming. The results show that players who prefer multiplayer gaming were more agreeable, more empathic and less aggressive than the ones who prefer single player. Discussion deals with the importance of considering individual characteristics of the target population while designing video games or serious games for health interventions. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","","Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Critical questions; Individual characteristics; Individual Differences; Multi-player gaming; Multiplayer games; Personality traits; Serious games for healths; Social abilities; Human computer interaction","","","","","","","Koo G., Seider S., Video games for prosocial learning, Ethics and Game Design: Teaching Values through Play, (2010); Gentile D.A., Erson C.A., Yukawa S., Ihori N., Saleem M., Ming L.K., Shibuya A., Liau A.K., Khoo A., Bushman B.J., Rowell Huesmann L., Sakamoto A., The effects of prosocial video games on prosocial behaviors international evidence from correlational, longitudinal, and experimental studies, Pers.

We report on the game Stop The Mob!, which was designed during a teacher education course at the University of Vienna where students were required to play serious games to experience how deep learning occurs with the goal of designing a serious game for the course’s final assessment. The focus of this paper is twofold. First we describe the course ‘Digital games, simulation and virtual worlds for teaching and learning’. Then we evaluate the design of Stop the Mob! and illustrate how it provides viable possibilities to situate learning, minimize cognitive load, engage the learner constructively and facilitate the learning task of preventing bullying when pedagogically embedded into classroom practice. In conclusion, we argue that educators can integrate the game into their pedagogical practice to fully actualize its potential to prevent bullying. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","","Education; Interactive computer graphics; Virtual reality; Classroom practices; Cognitive loads; Pedagogical practices; Pre-service teacher; Teacher education; Teaching and learning; University of Vienna; Virtual worlds; Teaching","","","","","","","Aldrich C., Learning Online with Games, Simulations, and Virtual Worlds: Strategies for Online Instruction, (2009); Banfield J., Wilkerson B., Increasing student intrinsic motivation and self-efficacy through gamification pedagogy, Contemp.

The ecosystem is based on rewarding proper user behavior through virtual and/or real-world incentives. The basis is provided by a seamlessly extensible set of apps allowing assessment of user behavior according to criteria related to green and collaborative mobility. The ecosystem looks particularly suited to the promotion of new mobility services. Users could be rewarded through incentives such as discounts from public authorities, mobility service providers, insurances. This is particularly interesting for companies willing to stay in constant contact with their customers and get data to improve their products and services. While the system has been developed for mobility-based games, the infrastructure is general and may be used in a variety of domains. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","","Ecology; Ecosystems; Business development; Constant contact; Extensible set; Green mobility; Mobility service; Products and services; Public authorities; User behaviors; Behavioral research","","","","","","","Prensky M., Digital game-based learning, ACM Comput.

Haptic technology has been proved to be useful in many applications with an additional perception modality complementary to the audio and the vision. It provides novel user experience to enhance the immersion of virtual reality with a physical control-layer. This survey focuses on the haptic technology and its applications in serious gaming. Several categories of related applications are listed and discussed in details, primarily on haptics acts as cognitive aux and main component in serious games design. We categorize haptic devices into tactile, force feedback and hybrid ones to suit different haptic interfaces, followed by description of common haptic gadgets in gaming. Haptic modeling methods, in particular, available SDKs or libraries either for commercial or academic usage, are summarized. We also analyze the existing research difficulties and technology bottleneck with haptics and foresee the future research directions. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.","Force feedback; Haptic devices; Haptic modeling; Serious games; Virtual reality","Force feedback; Haptic devices; Haptic model; Haptics; Serious games; Serious gaming; Virtual reality","","","","","","","Dondlinger M.J., Educational video game design: A review of the literature, J.

As a first theoretical result we outlined an initial rhetoric framework of gambling, connecting cognitive errors and superstitions to the design and interactive attributes of games of chance, and supported by former researches in the field. Secondly, we suggested an experimental application of our approach suitable for further researches: a set of digital interactive artifacts, as serious games, providing meaningful gambling experiences and intended to lead players towards a new consciousness about their approach to games of chance.  © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.","Gambling; Games of chance; Interaction design; Meaningful play; Pathological gambling; Play rhetoric","Gambling; Games of chance; Interaction design; Meaningful play; Pathological gambling; Play rhetoric","","","","","","","(2012); Caillois R., Man, Play, and Games, (2001); Croce M., Zerbetto R., (2001); Ladouceur R., Sylvain C., Boutin C., Doucet C., (2005); (1995); Griffiths M., Fruit machine gambling: The importance of structural characteristics, J.

Short and simple serious games can require to minimize instructions and feedback that otherwise risk to be perceived as obstructive for the game experience. Results obtained from a sample of 54 people show that both instructions and feedback are significantly linked to the expressed adequacy of the level of difficulty of the game. The expressed adequacy of the duration of the game has a significant role in mediating the relationship between the judgment on instructions and on the adequacy of the level of difficulty. The conclusion is that inadequate instructions and feedback are likely to be counterproductive, and they must be designed taking into account the duration and the level of difficulty of the game. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","","Computer science; Computers; Game experience; Level of difficulties; Serious games; Artificial intelligence","","","","","","","Hainey T., Connolly T.M., Stansfield M., Boyle L., The use of computer games in education: A review of the literature, Handbook of Research on Improving Learning and Motivation through Educational Games: Multidisciplinary Approaches, pp. 29-50, (2011); Boyle E., Connolly T.M., Hainey T., The role of psychology in understanding the impact of computer games, Entertainment Comput, 2, pp. 69-74, (2001); Okan Z., Edutainment: Is learning at risk?, Br.

Findings are presented on a study carried out on physical learning spaces and students’ engagement with these spaces (digital and physical). The paper also describes a pilot on the use of game mechanics in a blended learning environment. The findings will inform other projects that are investigating the crossings between gamification and pervasive gaming, including the potential of indoor mobile communication to support context-aware resources and future ‘learning spaces’. The holistic model may inform future initiatives in integrating knowledge, tools and services towards facilitating a pervasive and technology-enabled learning exploiting both physical and digital contents and contexts. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","","Blending; Computer aided instruction; Blended learning environments; Digital contents; Digital-learning; Mobile communications; Modular approach; Pervasive gaming; Pervasive learning; Technology-enabled learning; E-learning","","","","","DMLL","The work has been funded by the DMLL.

However, cognitive impairment causes a lot of difficulties to them when actively practicing these games. Their engagement and motivation are reduced rapidly when encountering successive problems without any help. In this paper, we present an approach to assist older adults in Serious Game using an interactive system. Three groups of players with different cognitive impairments (Mnesic Plaint, MCI and Alzheimer) have been tested with the system in a concentration-based game. As the experimental results, the players performed a high performance when playing with the assistance of the system, especially among Alzheimer group. The future work aims to perform this approach with a larger population and explore other factors which can influence on the players’ motivation. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","","Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Alzheimer; Cognitive impairment; Interactive system; Older adults; Serious games; Motivation","","","","","","","Belchior P.D.C., Cognitive training with video games to improve driving skills and driving safety among older adults, Dissertation Abs.

Serious game designers intend to generate engaging gameplay, which implies that voluntary play should be equally important for serious games as for entertainment games. This paper describes the outcome of a study on the impact of voluntariness on learning in a serious game. The results of 19 participants, randomly assigned to voluntary and mandatory gameplay, are analyzed to identify possible differences. The findings of this study suggest that, contrary to the opinion of many game designers, being required to play a serious game does not necessarily take the fun out of the game. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Effectiveness; Freedom of choice; Learning effect; Serious games","Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Effectiveness; Freedom of choice; Game designers; Gameplay; Important features; Learning effects; Serious games; Software design","","","","","","","Michael D., Chen S., Serious Games: Games that Educate, Train and Inform, (2006); Wu W., Hsiao H., Wu P., Lin C., Huang S., Investigating the learning-theory foundations of game-based learning: A meta-analysis, J.

This article clarifies positive conditions to use simulations and games in tertiary education. Based on a systematic review of literature we tentatively find a positive or neutral relationship between using simulations and games and achieving learning objectives. Also, we find three recurring conditions for successful use of simulations and games: the specificity of the game, the integration in the course, and the role of a guiding instructor. Finally, we express the strong need for a scientific framework to measure effectiveness of simulations and games. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","","Teaching; Learning objectives; Systematic Review; Tertiary education; Education","","","","","","","Krathwohl D., A revision of bloom’s taxonomy: An overview, Theor.

This mini SG makes it possible to have a real experience, even if in a simulated environment, on the concept of gain. Moreover, we will show that the direct involvement in the design of the mini SG by M., a young with neuro-motor disabilities, has made it possible to identify and solve the semantic problems that disabled users may encounter in the use of the game, which is the greatest difficulty in the design of this kind of mini SGs.

A game design team was confronted with a theory of tennis student dropout based on a distinction between four tennis kid types: the Tryer, Buyer, Flyer and High Flyer. An initial problem articulation and goal definition phase led to a concept that should encourage the transitions from Tryer to Buyer to Flyer. The concept consists of three parts: (1) an online platform revolving around a personal avatar with which skill development is tracked and encouraged; (2) a smartphone app of mini-games to train tennis tactics; (3) a QR-coded personal club card for tennis students to find each other and play a virtual tennis match with.

Therefore, it appears that truck drivers who had accidents are likely to suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder while no research does address this need. This paper tackles this point by the mean of an exposition therapy through the use of Virtual Reality technologies. Our main contribution concerns the fact that we do not only exploit Virtual Reality to expose the user. We do create an environment that offers to the patient the possibility to act in order to recover his ability to face the traumatic situation. For this, we rely on the game mechanics and the personalization of the virtual environment to bring the trucker to be active while being exposed to the cues that are related to its fear. Doing so, he should reactivate his capacities and thus be able to act differently in such a traumatic situation. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","","Accidents; Automobiles; Truck drivers; Virtual reality; Driving simulator; Exposed to; Gamification; Large-trucks; Personalizations; Post traumatic stress disorders; Virtual reality technology; Trucks","","","","","","","(2015); Wiederhold B.K., Bouchard S., Advances in Virtual Reality and Anxiety Disorders, (2014); Bohil C.J., Alicea B., Biocca F.A., Virtual reality in neuroscience research and therapy, Nat.

In the context of a graduate seminar, the students were organized in teams and were asked to design a serious game. In the early stages of the process, each team had the possibility to engage in a topic suggested by the professor or decide their topic of interest. Half of the teams choose a suggested topic (herd immunity, intergenerational communication, active ageing); the other half proposed a topic of their choice (inuits and micmacs, banker-customer relationship, French as a Foreign Language). In both cases, the students should engage in a participative design process which requires a learner-centered analysis. We analyze both the digital game design process and outcomes of the game design from the perspective of social participation and the 4C competencies deployed in the game design process: communication, collaboration, creativity and critical thinking. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","","Computer games; Education; Public relations; Students; Complex learning; Critical thinking; Customer relationships; Foreign language; Knowledge modelling; Learner-centered; Participative designs; Social participation; Design","","","","","Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC","The author aims to acknowledge the contribution to the revision of this manuscript by Hubert Ouellet, fellowship within the Ageing + Communication + Technology (ACT) project funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC).","Hassan M.M., Moreno A., Sutinen E., Aziz A., On the participatory design of Jeliot mobile: Towards a socio-constructivist mlearning tool, 2015 International Conference on Learning and Teaching in Computing and Engineering (Latice), pp. 120-123, (2015); Wingrave C., Norton J., Ross C., Ochoa N., Veazanchin S., Charbonneau E., Laviola J., Inspiring creative constructivist play, CHI 2012 Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 2339-2344, (2012); Romero M., Usart M., Ott M., Can serious games contribute to developing and sustaining 21st-century skills?, Games Cult.

This paper highlights the challenges associated with the implementation of pedagogical requisites and analyzes opportunities for enabling modular, scalable and more elastic DDD processes. To support the approach, the authors present the Reusability Serious Games Reusability Point of Reference (SGREF), a tool that aims to facilitate game modding and reengineering by capturing and structuring information on DDD processes.

It has been found to promote learning in a fun and interesting environment. Edutainment applications covered several fields including language learning. However, applications that focused on reading in language learning suffered from some limitations. These limitations include low interactivity and the lack of users’ reading assessment. In this paper, we will introduce iPlayAStory; an interactive online educational platform for language learning. iPlayAStory provides children with an entertaining application where they can read sentences aloud. The system then assesses the correctness of the children’s reading. Children are provided with feedback and can listen to the correct pronunciation. Moreover, iPlayAStory provides parents and teachers with a clear profile for their children’s performance on the application. Parents and teachers could also record stories with their voice to be played back for their children. iPlayAStory also serves as a platform for speech acquisition. The collected speech data could later be used to build an Automatic Speech Recognition system for detailed assessment of children’s pronunciation. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Edutainment; Games with a purpose; Language learning platform; Serious games","Computational linguistics; Education; Speech recognition; Teaching; Automatic speech recognition system; Educational platforms; Edutainment; Games with a purpose; Interactive stories; Language learning; Serious games; Speech acquisition; E-learning","","","","","","","Ritterfeld U., Cody M., Vorderer P., Serious Games: Mechanisms and Effects, (2009); Levi S.V., Talker familiarity and spoken word recognition in school-age children, J.

For reasons of statistical power we have combined student cohorts 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011, which led to a sample size of 118 students. The VIBOA games are inquiry-based games, which offer a lot of freedom of movement. Our premise is that this freedom of movement is accompanied by behavioural variability across individuals, which may influence the efficiency of learning. Descriptive statistics of our sample revealed such variability of diverse game parameters. We have identified “switching behaviour”, defined as the number of game objects (videos, resources, locations) accessed per unit time, as a relevant behavioural pattern. Multiple regression analysis showed that switching rates of videos and locations explain 54% of the variance of learning efficiency (defined as final score per unit time). Both the model and the model coefficients were significant beyond the 0.001 level. The same switching variables also account for 45% of the variance of total time spent. Predictive models of final score weren’t found. We conclude the paper by critically evaluating our findings, making explicit the limitations of our study and making suggestions for future research that links learning analytics and serious gaming. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.","","Game log; Serious gaming","","","","","","","Vandewalle D., Brown S.P., Cron W.L., Slocum L.W., The influence of goal orientation and self-regulation tactics on sales performance: a longitudinal field test, J.

The proposed system provides a learning method based on the user’s learning skill. By using the proposed system, users can solve exam-style questions wherever and whenever they choose. Efficient repetition learning is provided by using repetition periods based on the forgetting curve for long-term memory. The answered questions are then evaluated to update the user’s learning skill and the question difficulty. Due to this adaptive difficulty adjustment, users almost always receive questions that are appropriate for their skill level. If users answer questions correctly or learn more than the defined amount, then the proposed system provides them with encouraging feedback imagery. This is very similar to being rewarded for an achievable challenge in a game, and it can encourage users to study consistently. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","","Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Forgetting curve; Learning methods; Learning skills; Long term memory; Rate-matching; Skill levels; Vocabulary learning; Learning systems","","","","","Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (10047039); Korea Science and Engineering Foundation, KOSEF; Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, MEST, (2011-0012214); Institute for Information and Communications Technology Promotion, IITP","Funding text 1: This work was supported by Institute for Information & communications Technology Promotion(IITP) grant funded by the Korea government(MSIP) (No.10047039, Development of the realtime inspection SW and reverse engineering SW based on multiple 2D x-ray images and CT images).; Funding text 2: This work was supported by the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation(KOSEF) grant funded by the Korea government (MEST) (No. 2011-0012214).

This article argues that validation throughout the design process is vital for creating games that achieve their desired objective. It proposes a framework to integrate validation throughout the applied game design process. Iterative design and design fidelity levels form the foundation of the framework. In the framework four types of design fidelity (specifications, concepts, prototypes, and integrations) are linked to five types of validity (content, face, construct, concurrent and predictive validity), which lead to eight applicable validation tools and techniques. The framework is a starting point for further research into applied game validation. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","","Iterative methods; Design process; Game design; Iterative design; Validation tools; Design","","","","","","","Bellotti F., Kapralos B., Lee K., Moreno-Ger P., Berta R., Assessment in and of serious games: An overview, Adv.

From a practical perspective, this transition lacks methodology and requires a leap of faith from a prospective customer in the ability of a SG developer to deliver a game that will achieve the desired learning outcomes. A series of workshops were thus conducted to present and apply a preliminary exposition though a purpose-processing methodology to probe various SG design aspects, in particular how serious game design patterns map with pedagogical practices. The objective was to encourage dialogue and debate on core assumptions and emerging challenges to help develop robust methods and strategies to better SG design and its interconnectedness with pedagogy. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Game mechanics; Learning mechanics; Ludo-pedagogy mapping; Patterns; Pedagogically-driven game design","Design; Education; Java programming language; Mapping; Mechanics; Game design; Instructional designs; Learning outcome; Patterns; Pedagogical mechanisms; Pedagogical practices; Prospective customers; Robust methods; Education computing","","","","","Seventh Framework Programme, FP7, (FP7/2007 2013)","This project is partially funded under the European Community Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007 2013), Grant Agreement nr. 258169 and EPSRC/IMRC grants 113946 and 112430.","Suttie N., Louchart S., Lim T., Macvean A., Westera W., Brown D., Djaouti D., Introducing the “serious games mechanics” a theoretical framework to analyse relationships between “game” and “pedagogical aspects” of serious games, Procedia Comput.

Recent studies show that serious games are sometimes misused, and not always easy to integrate in an instructional environment. It is often unclear how a game contributes to student learning, or how it should be used in a course. This paper proposes a method to support the analysis, design, development, and use of serious games in education. The method combines the widely used design model ADDIE with the instructional design method ‘10 steps to complex learning’. The method is applied in the development of the Moth game, which supports learning optics at the level of high school physics. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.","Design methods; Games for physics; Instructional design; Serious games","Design; Education computing; Learning systems; Teaching; Complex learning; Design method; Design modeling; Educational game; High school; Instructional designs; Student learning; Serious games; Serious games; Education computing","","","","","","","Barab S.A., Dede C., Games and immersive participatory simulations for science education: An emerging type of curricula, J.

We developed and deployed four distinct modules of our game for use within a fifth grade classroom in Virginia, USA. Of the first three modules deployed, only one lead to statistically significant results from pre-test to post-test. We used qualitative information from these first three trials to develop a design framework for experiential serious games of this form. We then developed and tested a fourth module by applying this framework and found significant learning improvements with this fourth module. This paper presents our game, results of empirical studies within a fifth grade classroom, and our proposed design framework identifying key aspects of the learning environment. Our results provide support for our hypothesis that application of this framework leads to increased learning gains. While we do not suggest that our framework is complete or exhaustive, we believe that designers of similar educational games can benefit by employing the principles of this framework directly. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Elementary education; Experiential learning; History education; Serious games","Design; Design frameworks; Educational game; Elementary education; Empirical studies; Experiential learning; Learning environments; Qualitative information; Serious games; Computer aided instruction","","","","","","","Charsky D., From edutainment to serious games: A change in the use of game characteristics, Games Cult, 5, pp. 177-198, (2010); Westera W., Et al., Serious games for higher education: A framework for reducing design complexity, J.

A good serious game (SG) would be a very strong self-assessment tool because of the additional motivational aspects. However, self-assessment tools have to fit the learning matters of a course by 100%, what general SG seldom do. The goal of this work is to build a simple SG editor each teacher can adjust to the learning goals of his course. Here we present the development of a game-editor for teachers for a puzzle-style game. By this editor teachers can edit their own course based game without sophisticated computer knowledge. The game mechanics meet the requirements of mobile- and micro-learning strategies. Furthermore, the game implements learning analytics for students as well as for teachers. The game engine and the editor are both based on standard Web technologies. The source code is maintained as an open source project to lower the barriers for further uptake. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","","Computer games; Education; Open source software; Open systems; Computer knowledge; Learning goals; Micro-learning; Open source projects; Self assessment; Self-assessment tools; Student performance; Web technologies; Teaching","","","","","","","Abadel F.T., Hattab A.S., Patients’ assessment of professionalism and communication skills of medical graduates, BMC Med.

Here, new communities of practice are being established to promote an engagement economy that will be able to foster innovation and success by sustaining collective well-being and group flourishing. Considered as “positive technologies”, Serious Games (SGs) can support these processes. By fostering continuous learning experiences blended with entertaining affordances, SGs have in fact been able to shape new opportunities for human psychological training and assessment. However, despite the impressive growth of SGs applications, only a few of them have been tested and scientifically considered from an empirical point of view. Our study tries to address this gap, evaluating the potential of digital game technology compared to paper-based applications not only among individuals, but also among groups. The study, conducted with Mind the Game, a multiplayer SG, involved 75 students. Preliminary results showed only minor but fundamental differences between the two experimental conditions. On the one hand, groups who experienced the paper-based condition felt more competent than groups exposed to the digital experience, reporting higher levels of negative feelings too. On the other hand, groups exposed to the digital condition described themselves as more challenged and efficient in a collective way. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","","Computers; Communities of Practice; Continuous learning; Digital games; Digital gaming; Experimental conditions; Human performance; Serious games; User experience; Artificial intelligence","","","","","","","Barabasi A.L., Linked: The New Science of Networks, (2002); McGonigal J., Reality is Broken, (2010); Baker D.P., Day R., Salas P., Teamwork as an essential component of high-reliability organizations.

Game design frameworks are still under development and do not help to articulate the educational merits of a game to a teacher nor fit with their background. In this paper we discuss the results of a GaLA workshop which examined how a widely applied instructional design model, 4C-ID, can ease the uptake of serious games by offering teachers a model fitting their background to assess games on the applicability for their learning contexts. The paper will introduce the 4C-ID model and its use in the CHERMUG project with the design of mini-games for research methods and statistics. Next, we will discuss how workshop participants used the 4C-ID model to evaluate two games on their applicability for a given learning context. The participants indicated that the approach can support teachers in deciding if and how to use a given serious game. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","","Gaining insights; Serious games","","","","","European Commission, EC, (519023-LLP-1-2011-1-UK-KA3-KA3MP)","The work described in this paper was partially supported by the European Community under the Lifelong Learning Programme project CHERMUG nr. 519023-LLP-1-2011-1-UK-KA3-KA3MP.

Current Fort Ross is a popular California State Historic Park visited every year by over 100,000 visitors from all over the world. In March 2011, California State Parks and the University of California Merced started the Fort Ross Virtual Warehouse project— a digital scholarship initiative aimed to enhance a pilot serious game on Fort Ross developed by California State Parks Staff in the early 2000s—with the goal to explore novel ways for archiving, disseminating, and teaching cultural and historical information.

Yet it is a necessary experience for engineering education since engineering in the real world are team-based events that build from individual knowledge. This paper reports on the learning of supply chain management (SCM), a fundamental component in engineering manufacturing operations and logistics planning. The study investigates the use of SHORTFALL a team-based game in conjunction with various degrees of facilitation, supported with taught material. Early results from two separate and independent studies indicate that the usefulness of using SHORTFALL in classes regarding the students' experience and learning outcomes depends on the prior knowledge of the students as well as on the use of an expert facilitator. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","","Education; Supply chain management; Teaching; Fundamental component; Learning outcome; Logistics planning; Manufacturing operations; Personalized learning; Prior knowledge; Serious games; Supply chain managements (SCM); Engineering education","","","","","Seventh Framework Programme, FP7, (258169); European Commission, EC","This work has been co-funded by the EU under the FP7, in the Games and Learning Alliance (GALA) Network of Excellence, Grant Agreement nr. 258169.","Starkey K., Tempest S., The future of the business school: Knowledge challenges and opportunities, Hum.

In physics, this requires students to connect physical phenomena, physics principles, and physics symbols. This can be learned on paper, but interactive tools may increase the learner’s ability to contextualize the problem. Computer simulations provide students with graphical models that join phenomena and principles in physics. However, a minimally guided approach may make learning difficult, since it overburdens the working memory. In particular, for developing problem solving skills, students need to be guided and exercise with a variety of physics problems. Intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) can be a useful tool to fill this gap. Thus, we have developed a physics game to support inquiry learning and retrieval practicing using simulation and knowledge based tutorship (QTut), and implemented as a puzzle game that uses driving questions to encourage students to explore the simulation. To address scalability and reusability, the game features different difficulty levels atop of a customizable format. This allows us to explore in-game adaptivity, exploiting task and user models that rely on the flow framework. User tests are being executed to evaluate the usefulness of the game. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","","Computer aided instruction; Education; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Knowledge based systems; Reusability; Students; Body of knowledge; Inquiry learning; Intelligent tutoring system; Interactive tool; Knowledge domains; Learning physics; Physical phenomena; Problem solving skills; Problem solving","","","","","EACEA Agency of the European Commission, (EMJD ICE FPA n 2010-0012); Games and Learning Alliance, (258169); Seventh Framework Programme, FP7; European Commission, EC","This work was supported in part by the Erasmus Mundus Joint Doctorate in Interactive and Cognitive Environments, which is funded by the EACEA Agency of the European Commission under EMJD ICE FPA n 2010-0012.

Despite the many existing design frameworks, these games are too often created in an adhoc manner, and typically without the use of a game design document (GDD). We argue that a reason for this phenomenon is that current ways to structure, create and update GDDs do not increase the value of the artifact in the design and development process. As a solution, we propose a model-driven, web-based knowledge management environment that supports game designers in the creation of a GDD that accounts for and relates educational and entertainment game elements. The foundation of our approach is our devised conceptual model for educational games, which also defines the structure of the design environment. We present promising results from an evaluation of our environment with eight experts in serious games. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","","Design; Education; Knowledge management; Portals; Conceptual model; Design and development process; Design environment; Design frameworks; Educational game; Game design document; Game designers; Management environments; Structural design","","","","","","","Aleven V., Myers E., Easterday M., Ogan A., Toward a framework for the analysis and design of educational games, Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Digital Game and Intelligent Toy Enhanced Learning (DIGITEL), pp. 69-76, (2010); Amory A., Naicker K., Vincent J., Adams C., The use of computer games as an educational tool: Identification of appropriate game types and game elements, Br.

Is it possible that different input methods provide a more usable game setting and affect the player’s emotions and learning process? In this paper, a 2D game about the history of photography was designed and implemented to test these hypotheses. Two prototypes of this game were created, with the first requiring input only via mouse, while the second requiring input via voice and gestures (Kinect). Two different groups tested these two prototypes. The findings from previous pilot experiments indicated that using Kinect as an input method caused higher valence and dominance levels than the use of mouse and were further validated here. Additionally, the learning outcomes of players were not affected by the input method. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","","Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Game controller; Input modalities; Learning outcome; Learning process; Microsoft kinect; Pilot experiment; Player experience; User experience; Mammals","","","","","","","Ma M., Bale K., Rea P., Constructionist learning in anatomy education, SGDA 2012.

The primary aim of the initiative was to investigate the integration of Serious Games-based learning environments in the school study of humanities subjects. The pilot was carried out as part of investigations that researchers in the Games and Learning Alliance (GALA) Network of Excellence are conducting into the adoption and deployment of Serious Games (SG) in formal learning contexts. In this regard, the paper outlines the sequence of deployed pilot activities, which was shaped with the intention of responding to the needs of all the participants involved - researchers, educators and learners. This approach is inspired by the principles of design-based research, as illustrated in the strategies adopted both for piloting activities and data gathering. The paper reports the outcome of these and considers some implications of the adopted approach both for SG deployment in formal education and for implementation of experimental SG pilots of this kind. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Design-Based research; Experimental pilot; Game-Based learning; Serious games","Artificial intelligence; Computers; Design-based research; Experimental pilot; Game-based Learning; Learning alliances; Learning environments; Piloting activities; Principles of design; Serious games; Computer aided instruction","","","","","European Commission, EC; Seventh Framework Programme, FP7","The work reported in this paper has been performed as part of research activities conducted within the Game and Learning Alliance (GALA) Network of Excellence, co-funded by the EU under the Seventh Framework Programme.

A lot of studies are focusing on the clinical efficacy of such kind on new interventions. However there is still, currently, a lack of information about the importance of learning effect of the task (e.g. motions required to play the game). Therefore the aim of this study was to evaluate the importance of motor learning during rehabilitation exercises performed with specially developed Serious Games. Ten healthy adults played 9 sessions of games over a 3 weeks period. Different parameters were extracted from the games to performed functional and biomechanical evaluation. ANOVA and ICC were processed to evaluate reproducibility of measurement. The majority of the learning effect occurred during the very first session. Therefore, in order to allow regular monitoring the results of this first session should not be included in the follow-up of the patient. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","","Biomechanics; Biomechanical analysis; Biomechanical evaluation; Clinical efficacy; Learning effects; Motor learning; Physical rehabilitation; Rehabilitation exercise; Reproducibilities; Human computer interaction","","","","","","","Bonnechere B., Jansen B., Omelina L., Degelaen M., Wermenbol V., Rooze M., Van Sint Jan S., Can serious games be incorporated with conventional treatment of children with cerebral palsy?

Surprise involves an emotional reaction, but it also serves a cognitive goal as it directs attention to explain why the surprising event occurred and to learn for the future. Experiment 1 - comparing a surprise condition with a control condition - found no differences, but the results suggested that surprise may be beneficial for higher level students. In Experiment 2 we combined Expectancy strength (Strong vs. Weak) with Surprise (Present vs. Absent) using higher level students. We found a marginal effect of surprise on learning indicating that students who experienced surprises learned more than students who were not exposed to these surprises but we found a stronger positive effect of surprise when we included existing proportional reasoning skill as factor. These results provide evidence that narrative techniques such as surprise can be used for the purpose of learning. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","","Education; Emotional reactions; Exposed to; Game-based Learning; Marginal effects; Students","","","","","Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO, (411-00-003)","This research is funded by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (project Number No. 411-00-003).","Foster M.I., Keane M.T., Predicting surprise judgments from explanation graphs, International Conference on Cognitive Modeling (ICCM).

Such datasets are today difficult to obtain as, on the one hand, building smart facilities is expensive, requiring considerable costs for maintenance and extension, and, on the other hand, freely available datasets are scarce, not continuously updated and contain a limited set of sensors, thus not allowing the evaluation of algorithms that require the availability of specific categories of sensors. To this aim, we have built a prototype smart virtual environment producing sensor logs on the basis of activities performed by users as if they were really acting in a physical smart space. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","","Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Activity monitoring; Ambient intelligence; Gamification; Novel techniques; Sensor logs; Smart space; Virtual reality","","","","","Italian cluster SM&ST - Social Museum and Smart Tourism; European Commission, EC, (621137)","This work has been partly supported by the EU project VOICE (621137), the Italian cluster SM&ST - Social Museum and Smart Tourism, and the Italian project NEPTIS.

In these games, the educational goal changes the issues related to the simulation design. In particular, achieving right balance between realism and teaching effectiveness is an essential design criterion. The difficulties in designing this type of serious games are particularly evident in the social field. In fact, this area is characterized by a complexity that is hard to design in formal terms. Starting from recent evolutions in the field of social simulation, this paper proposes the agent paradigm as a methodological tool to guide the design of serious games in the social field. The PNPV game, designed within the framework of the European project “I can … I cannot … I go!” Rev. 2 (PNPV project), which aims to introduce and foster an entrepreneurial mindset among young people, is described as a case study of a serious game developed by means of the agent based approach. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.","","Agent-based methodologies; Serious games","","","","","","","Blikstein P., Wilensky U., MaterialSim: A constructionist agent-based modeling approach to engineering education, Designs for Learning Environments of the Future: International Perspectives from the Learning Sciences, pp. 17-60, (2010); De Freitas S., Using games and simulations for supporting learning, Learn.

Serious games may be well suited to teaching animal behavior as they allow for easy control of what is being presented as well as interaction, in terms of moving around the environment and effecting behaviour of the virtual animals. We compare how the visual qualities of computer generated imagery (CGI) and film impact on learning and enjoyment. The reason for this comparison was partly as other work has shown how some human behaviour can be more easily communicated using CGI and to allow the impact of visual qualities to be better understood before studying the interactive CGI environments. Our findings suggest that when viewpoint is fixed people can identify animal behaviour equally well in both mediums. This validates further experimentation into the advantages of free viewpoint. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Serious games; Virtual animals; Virtual environments; Virtual learning","Animals; Social sciences; Virtual reality; Animal behaviour; Computer generated imagery; Human behaviours; Serious games; Social interactions; Teaching materials; Virtual learning; Visual qualities; Behavioral research","","","","","","","Morgan P., Cleave-Hogg D., McLlroy J., Devitt J., Simulation technology a comparison of experiential and visual learning for undergraduate medical students, Anesthesiology, 96, pp. 10-16, (2002); Adams R., Finn P., Moes E., Flannery K., Rizzo A., Distractibility in Attention/Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD): The virtual reality classroom, Child Neuropsychol, 15, pp. 120-135, (2009); Rizzo A., Kim G.J., A SWOT analysis of the field of virtual reality rehabilitation and therapy, Presence, 14, pp. 119-146, (2005); Goossens B., Setchel J., Tchidango E., Dilamaka E., Vidal C., Ancrenaz M., Jamart A., Survival, interaction with conspecifics and reproduction in 37 chimpanzees released into the wild, Biol.

The underlying principle of the concept is a two-tiered students-for-students-approach, which encompasses on the first level the design, development and implementation of a SG for project management by 3rd year students in Business Information Systems Engineering (BISE). The SG then gets incorporated into courses on the respective topic in other degree courses of the same institution. Given the promising potential of SGs in higher education in general and the multiple application options for Serious Games specifically in BISE, the authors argue that their concept can provide a solution for some of the limiting issues to enabling a broader application of SGs such as time-consuming and costly development or alignment of SGs to the curriculum of the target group. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","","Curricula; Education; Information management; Project management; Business information systems; Double effects; Higher education; Higher education institutions; Multiple applications; Serious games; Target group; Underlying principles; Students","","","","","","","Hugger K., Walber M., Digitale Lernwelten: Annäherungen aus der Gegenwart, Digitale Lernwelten, pp. 9-20, (2010); Bellotti F., Et al., Designing a course for stimulating entrepreneurship in higher education through serious games, Procedia Comput.

This study presents a comparison of five methodological frameworks for digital learning game design, highlighting their similarities and differences. The objective is to support the choice of an adequate framework, aiming to promote them as a way to foster principled digital learning games design. This paper concludes that: (i) interactivity, engagement and increasing complexity of challenges are fundamental factors to digital learning game design; (ii) the pedagogical base, the target, the possibility of doing game assessment and the presence of practical guidelines are the selection criteria that influence most the choice of a methodological framework, and (iii) the development of digital learning games - preferably by different research teams - is needed to provide empirical evidence of the utility of framework-based design. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Digital learning; Educational; Game-based learning; Games; Methodological frameworks","Design; Education computing; Digital-learning; Educational; Game-based Learning; Games; Methodological frameworks; E-learning","","","","","","","Connolly T.M., Boyle E.A., Macarthur E., Hainey T., Boyle J.M., A systematic literature review of empirical evidence on computer games and serious games, Comput.

It is commonplace in face-to-face interaction as well as on-line communities that facilitate work related collaboration of cross-border teams. To effectively work in these international surroundings, individuals resort to commonly understood, vehicular languages. In work-related contexts, impeccable use of a language is less important than effective communication towards addressing common goals. This work departs from typical professional language learning approaches by introducing a serious game for building language and cultural communication skills in a lingua franca. The game exposes professionals to typical deployment of a lingua franca by native and non-native speakers. Learners build communication competence through situated learning approaches that draw inspiration from the real world, which is both multilingual and multicultural. At the same time they become aware of the cultural wealth that is manifested in the individualized uses of vehicular languages by individuals with diverse backgrounds. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.","","Language learning; Serious games","","","","","European Commission, EC","This work is funded with the support of the European Commission.

It provides a clearly defined tree of axioms that maps the player’s visually manifested affective cues and emotional stimuli from the serious game to conflict handling styles and proposes interventions. The importance of this ontology lies in the fact that it promotes natural interaction (non-invasive methods) and at the same time makes the game as player-specific as it can be for its educational goal. It is an ontology that can be adapted to different educational theories and serve various educational purposes.  © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.","Conflict; Emotion analysis; Ontology; Serious game","Conflict; Emotion analysis; Serious games; Ontology","","","","","FP7 Information and Communication Technologies, ICT, (258453); European Commission, EC; European Social Fund, ESF","This research was co-financed by the FP7 ICT project SIREN (project no: 258453) and by the European Union (European Social Fund ESF) and Greek national funds through the Operational Program “Education and Lifelong Learning” of the National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF) Research Funding Program: “THALES.

Coupled with complex functionality and poor user experience the learning curve is often steep and overwhelming. Invoking design creativity remains limited to conveying established geometry. Gameplay conversely excels in memorable and formative experiences and could spur intuition and natural creativity. If games are profoundly imbued for purposeful play, thriving on tacit and explicit user knowledge, a CAD system carefully stylized with ludic mechanisms could potentially be highly productive. An emergent serious game (SG) and CAD system may then hold promise. Preliminary feedbacks suggest a game-CAD environment incorporating interoperable mechanisms of CAD and SG systems to exchange creation improves user interactions resulting in better evolution of the workflow. The emerging scenarios presented reports a transformative approach to understanding of relationships in CAD use, learning and play mechanisms that enhance creativity and innovation. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.","","Serious gaming","","","","","European Commission, EC; Seventh Framework Programme, FP7, (FP7/2007 2013); Seventh Framework Programme, FP7, (258169)","This project is partially funded under the European Community Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007 2013), Grant Agreement nr. 258169 and EPSRC/IMRC grants 113946 and 112430.","Hesmer A., Hribernik K., Baalsrud Hauge J., Thoben K.-D., Supporting the ideation processes by a collaborative online based toolset, Int.

Discovering new talent or refreshing strategies are long-term investments for all competitive F1 teams. The F1 world and teams invest vast amounts in developing high-fidelity simulators; however, driving games have seldom been associated with uncovering certain natural abilities. Beyond nature and nurture to attain success at the top level, certain motor-cognitive aspects are paramount for proficiency. One method of potentially finding talent is studying the behavioral and cognitive patterns associated with learning. Here, an F1 simulation game was used to demonstrate how learning had taken place. The indicative change of interest is from cognitive to motor via more skilled autonomous driving style –a skill synonymous with expert driving and ultimately winning races.

The enjoyment level that a serious game offers is a key factor in determining whether the player will be engaged in the gameplay and achieve the objectives of the game. In this paper the usefulness of flow experience in evaluating the quality of physically activating problem-solving game was studied. The aim of the paper is to explore to what extend the flow experience can facilitate the game evaluation and design process. In the study 53 junior high school students played a cooperative exergame designed to teach collaboration and communication skills. Students’ playing experience was measured with a flow questionnaire and playing behavior was also observed. In general, the results indicated that the measurement of the flow experience can reveal shortages of the game and that way aid the design process. However, although the level of flow tells about the overall quality of the playing experience, the flow measurements needs to be extended with other aspects in order to be able to evaluate the implementation of the game more deeply. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.","","Flow experience; Quality measures; Serious games","","","","","Seventh Framework Programme, FP7, (258169); European Commission, EC","This work has been co-funded by the EU under the FP7, in the Games and Learning Alliance (GALA) Network of Excellence, Grant Agreement nr. 258169.","Procci K., Singer A.R., Levy K.R., Bowers C., Measuring the flow experience of gamers: An evaluation of the DFS-2, Comput.

A significant example is “Cultural Awareness–Afghanistan Pre-deployment”, a serious game distributed by UK MoD and widely adopted in Defence Schools to support pre-deployment training of troops in Afghanistan. In the context of GALA, the European Network of Excellence on Serious Games, the Romanian National Defence University and NATO-STO CMRE conducted a user study focused on the learning impact of this serious game. The study was first run in parallel on different typologies of players in order to get different perspectives of evaluation; respective results were then merged and compared to achieve a more complete view, and, hence a better understanding of the advantages and limitations of this type of learning tool. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.","","Afghanistan; Cultural awareness; User study","","","","","","","(2001); Breuer J., Bente G., Why so serious?

However, the analysis of knowledge convergence has been mostly developed in the context of Asynchronous Learning Networks (ALN) in a qualitative approach, but has not been investigated in the context of collaborative Serious Games (SG). The present study aims to investigate students’ knowledge convergence in the particular case of the SG Metavals, using a quantitative approach. The knowledge convergence results of the dyads playing the MetaVals allows to sustain partially the hypothesis of a better performance and Level of Certainty (LC) (H1), a higher symmetry of knowledge (H2) and a higher shared outcome knowledge (H3), after collaboration than in the initial individual phase of the SG. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.","","Quantitative approach; Serious games","","","","","","","Johnson D., Johnson R., Learning Together and Alone, Cooperative, Competitive, and Individualistic Learning, (1994); Romero M., Usart M., Ott M., Earp J., De Freitas S., Arnab S., Learning through playing for or against each other?

These models promote enhanced interaction and responsiveness. Under the social web paradigm more and more usable game authoring tools become available that enable prosumers to create their own games, but the inclusion of dynamic simulations remains a specialist’s job involving knowledge of mathematics, numerical modeling and programming. This paper describes a methodology for specifying and running a specific subset of computational models without the need of bothering with mathematical equations. The methodology comprises a knowledge elicitation procedure for identifying and specifying the required model components, whereupon the mathematical model is automatically generated. The approach is based on the fact that many games focus on optimisation problems that are covered by a general class of linear programming models. The paper thus sketches the principles of a creativity tool that removes barriers for harvesting the creative potential of teachers and students. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.","","Computational model; Serious gaming","","","","","","","Aldrich C., The Complete Guide to Simulations and Serious Games: How the Most Valuable Content Will Be Created in the Age Beyond Gutenberg to Google, (2009); David M.M., Watson A., Participating in what?
